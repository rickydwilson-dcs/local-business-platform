# Edge Protection

We install guardrail systems for roof perimeters, mezzanines, and leading edges. Options include freestanding weighted rails (no penetrations) and scaffold-mounted rails integrated with your access scaffold. Designs prioritise safe workflows while maintaining clear access for roofers and cladders.
