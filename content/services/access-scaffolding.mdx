  - question: "What is access scaffolding and when do I need it?"

    answer: "TG20:21 is the NASC (National Access & Scaffolding Confederation) technical guidance ensuring scaffolds are designed and erected to the highest safety standards. All our access scaffolding meets TG20:21 specifications, giving you legal compliance and peace of mind."
  - question: "Do you provide scaffolding inspections and handover certificates?"
