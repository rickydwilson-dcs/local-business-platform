## FAQs

**Q: What makes industrial scaffolding different from standard scaffolding?**
A: Industrial scaffolding is engineered for heavier loads, larger spans, and more complex configurations. It requires enhanced tie patterns, reinforced platforms, and specialized design calculations to support industrial equipment, material storage, and heavy-duty operations that standard scaffolding can't accommodate.

**Q: What load capacities can your industrial scaffolding support?**
A: Our industrial scaffolding systems are designed for loads from standard duty (0.75 kN/m²) up to heavy duty (3.0 kN/m² or more). Each structure is engineered with specific load calculations to safely support your equipment, materials, and operational requirements.

**Q: Do you provide scaffolding for plant shutdowns and maintenance?**
A: Yes. We specialize in planned shutdown scaffolding for factories, power plants, refineries, and industrial facilities. Our teams work to tight schedules, providing rapid installation and dismantling to minimize downtime during critical maintenance windows.

**Q: Can industrial scaffolding be installed in live operational environments?**
A: Absolutely. We regularly install scaffolding in operational facilities with strict safety protocols, permit-to-work systems, and minimal disruption procedures. Our teams are experienced in working around live plant, machinery, and ongoing industrial operations.

**Q: What certifications do your industrial scaffolding teams hold?**
A: All our industrial scaffolding teams are CISRS-qualified with additional certifications for confined spaces, PASMA, IPAF, and asbestos awareness. Many hold advanced scaffolding qualifications and site-specific industrial training for sectors including chemical, pharmaceutical, and energy.

**Q: How quickly can you mobilize for industrial projects in Kent and Sussex?**
A: We can typically mobilize industrial scaffolding teams within 24-48 hours for emergency situations. Planned projects receive detailed pre-installation surveys, design documentation, and scheduled installation to meet your shutdown or project timelines.

**Q: Do you provide temporary works design for industrial scaffolding?**
A: Yes. All heavy-duty industrial scaffolding includes full temporary works design by qualified engineers, with structural calculations, load specifications, and design drawings meeting BS 5975 and client-specific requirements.
