# Access Scaffolds

Our access scaffolds provide stable platforms for roofing, rendering, painting, and general refurbishment. We build clean, compliant lifts to TG20:21 guidance, sized to your trade’s workflow. Typical configurations include single and double lifts, returns, and stepped access over conservatories or extensions.

We keep sites tidy and neighbours happy, with neat ties, debris control, and careful footings on delicate surfaces. If your project overlaps a pavement or public space, we can handle permits and install protection fans or tunnels to keep people safe.
