## FAQs

**Q: What are temporary roof systems and when are they needed?**
A: Temporary roof systems provide weather protection for buildings during roof replacement, major repairs, or structural work. They're essential when your building needs to remain dry and operational while the permanent roof is removed or being repaired.

**Q: How long can a temporary roof system stay in place?**
A: Our temporary roof systems can remain installed for weeks or months depending on your project timeline. They're designed for long-term weather resistance and are regularly inspected to ensure continued protection throughout your works.

**Q: What types of buildings can have temporary roofing installed?**
A: We install temporary roof systems on residential homes, commercial buildings, industrial facilities, and heritage properties. Systems can be adapted for any building size, from small cottages to large commercial structures across Sussex and Kent.

**Q: Will a temporary roof keep the building completely dry?**
A: Yes. Our temporary roof systems are fully weatherproof and designed to protect against rain, snow, and wind. They allow interior work to continue uninterrupted regardless of weather conditions, preventing water damage and project delays.

**Q: How quickly can you install a temporary roof system?**
A: Installation time varies by building size. Small residential roofs can typically be covered within 1-2 days, while larger commercial buildings may take 3-7 days. We can provide emergency installations for urgent weather protection needs.

**Q: Can temporary roofs withstand coastal weather conditions?**
A: Absolutely. We regularly install temporary roof systems in coastal areas including Brighton and Hastings, where they're engineered to withstand strong winds, salt air, and extreme weather typical of seaside locations.

**Q: How much does a temporary roof system cost?**
A: Costs depend on building size, roof complexity, and installation duration. We provide free, detailed quotes based on your specific requirements. The investment often pays for itself by preventing weather delays and protecting valuable interior work.

**Q: Do you remove and reinstall temporary roofs if needed?**
A: Yes. If your project requires temporary roof removal for crane access or other operations, we can remove and reinstall the system as needed throughout your project timeline.
