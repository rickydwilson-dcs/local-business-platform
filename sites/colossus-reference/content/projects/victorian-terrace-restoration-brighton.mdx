  - question: "How did you manage the narrow street access?"
    answer: "We coordinated with Brighton & Hove City Council for temporary traffic management during delivery. Modular components were used to minimise disruption and allow efficient assembly in the restricted space."
  - question: "What made this project particularly challenging?"
    answer: "The combination of heritage requirements, coastal wind exposure, and limited access required careful design. We developed a bespoke scaffold plan that addressed all constraints while maintaining full compliance."

This Victorian terrace restoration project in Brighton's North Laine conservation area showcases our expertise in heritage scaffolding solutions. The Grade II listed property required careful planning and execution to ensure the historic fabric was protected throughout the works.

## The Challenge

The homeowners needed comprehensive scaffold access for a full facade restoration, including:

- Replacement of original sash windows
- Repointing of historic brickwork
- Chimney stack repairs and repointing
- External decoration

The project presented several unique challenges that required specialist knowledge and careful planning.

## Our Approach

Working closely with the conservation officer, we developed a scaffold design that provided full working access while minimising contact points with the historic building. Key elements included:

- **Heritage-approved fixings** - All ties and fixings used methods that don't penetrate or damage the historic fabric
- **Protective measures** - Padded sleeves and boarding at every contact point
- **Coastal wind design** - Additional bracing to account for Brighton's exposed coastal position
- **Phased installation** - Work coordinated with the restoration contractor's programme

## The Result

The project was completed successfully within the 8-week programme, with the scaffolding providing safe, comprehensive access for all restoration works. The conservation officer commended our approach, and the homeowners were delighted with both the scaffolding service and the care taken with their historic property.
