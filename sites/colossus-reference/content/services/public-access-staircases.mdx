faqs:
  - question: "What are public access staircases and when are they needed?"
    answer: "Public access staircases are temporary stair systems that maintain safe public access through or around construction sites. They're legally required when construction work blocks existing staircases, building entrances, or pedestrian routes, ensuring continued accessibility during building works."
  - question: "Do public access staircases need to be DDA/Equality Act compliant?"
    answer: "Yes. Public access staircases must comply with Equality Act requirements including appropriate gradients, handrails, and where possible, ramped access alternatives. We design all public access systems to meet current accessibility legislation and building control standards."
  - question: "Can you provide temporary staircases for multi-story buildings?"
    answer: "Yes. We install temporary staircase systems serving multiple floors, providing safe egress and access during construction or refurbishment. These systems are designed for heavy use, meeting fire escape requirements and building regulation specifications."
  - question: "What's the difference between public access and fire escape staircases?"
    answer: "Public access staircases allow ongoing building use during construction. Fire escape staircases meet Part B building regulations for emergency egress, often requiring enhanced specifications, dedicated routes, and building control approval. Many installations serve both functions."
  - question: "How quickly can temporary staircases be installed?"
    answer: "Single-flight staircases can typically be installed within 1-2 days. Multi-story systems serving several floors may take 3-7 days depending on height and complexity. We coordinate installation to minimize disruption to building operations."
  - question: "Do you handle building control approvals for temporary staircases?"
    answer: "Yes. We manage all building control notifications and approvals, providing structural calculations, design drawings, and compliance documentation. Our staircases meet all regulatory requirements for projects throughout Kent and Sussex."
  - question: "Can temporary staircases withstand heavy public use?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Our public access staircases are designed for intensive use with appropriate load ratings, anti-slip treads, and robust construction. They're regularly inspected and maintained throughout their installation period."
  - question: "Are temporary staircases suitable for coastal locations?"
    answer: "Yes. We install weather-resistant temporary staircases in coastal areas including Brighton and Hastings, with corrosion protection, enhanced stability for wind exposure, and drainage systems to prevent water accumulation on treads."

  - question: "How much do public access staircases cost?"
    answer: "Public access staircase costs depend on the number of flights, width requirements, accessibility features, and project duration. Single-flight installations typically start from £1,500, while multi-story systems serving several floors can range from £5,000-£20,000+. We provide detailed quotations based on your specific requirements."
  - question: "What maintenance is required for temporary public staircases?"
    answer: "Public access staircases require regular inspection and cleaning to maintain safe use. We provide weekly structural inspections, daily cleaning services where required, and prompt maintenance response for any wear or damage. All inspection records are maintained for compliance purposes."
  - question: "Can temporary staircases be enclosed for weather protection?"
    answer: "Yes, we can provide enclosed staircase systems with weatherproof canopies and side screens to protect users from rain and wind. Enclosed systems are particularly suitable for multi-story buildings where exposed staircases would be uncomfortable or unsafe during adverse weather."
