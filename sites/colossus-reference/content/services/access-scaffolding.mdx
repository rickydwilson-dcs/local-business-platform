  - question: "What is access scaffolding and when do I need it?"

  - question: "How quickly can you install access scaffolding?"
    answer: "For standard residential projects, we typically install within 24-48 hours. Larger commercial or complex industrial projects may require 3-5 days including design and engineering. We offer emergency scaffolding services across Sussex and Kent for urgent requirements."
  - question: "What does TG20:21 compliance mean for my project?"
    answer: "TG20:21 is the NASC (National Access & Scaffolding Confederation) technical guidance ensuring scaffolds are designed and erected to the highest safety standards. All our access scaffolding meets TG20:21 specifications, giving you legal compliance and peace of mind."
  - question: "Do you provide scaffolding inspections and handover certificates?"
    answer: "Yes. Every scaffold receives a full handover certificate upon completion. We then conduct statutory inspections every 7 days, after any modifications, and following adverse weather conditions. All inspection records are provided to you for HSE compliance."

  - question: "How long does scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can be erected in 4-8 hours, while commercial projects may take 1-3 days. We schedule installations to minimise disruption and can often complete same-day setup for standard domestic projects."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding?"
    answer: "Scaffolding on private property typically doesn't require planning permission. However, if scaffolding extends onto public pavements or highways, you'll need a licence from the local council. We handle all necessary permits and licences on your behalf."
