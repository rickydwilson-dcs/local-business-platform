faqs:
  - question: "What is access scaffolding and when do I need it?"
    answer: "Access scaffolding provides safe working platforms for tasks requiring height access - from residential roof repairs and painting to commercial building maintenance. If you're working above ground level and need stable, compliant access, access scaffolding is the solution."
  - question: "How quickly can you install access scaffolding?"
    answer: "For standard residential projects, we typically install within 24-48 hours. Larger commercial or complex industrial projects may require 3-5 days including design and engineering. We offer emergency scaffolding services across Sussex and Kent for urgent requirements."
  - question: "What does TG20:21 compliance mean for my project?"
    answer: "TG20:21 is the NASC (National Access & Scaffolding Confederation) technical guidance ensuring scaffolds are designed and erected to the highest safety standards. All our access scaffolding meets TG20:21 specifications, giving you legal compliance and peace of mind."
  - question: "Do you provide scaffolding inspections and handover certificates?"
    answer: "Yes. Every scaffold receives a full handover certificate upon completion. We then conduct statutory inspections every 7 days, after any modifications, and following adverse weather conditions. All inspection records are provided to you for HSE compliance."
  - question: "How much does access scaffolding cost?"
    answer: "Residential access scaffolding typically ranges from £800-£2,500 depending on height, duration, and complexity. Commercial projects vary based on scale and requirements. We provide free site surveys and detailed quotations with no hidden costs."
  - question: "Can you erect scaffolding on uneven ground or difficult terrain?"
    answer: "Yes. Our CISRS-qualified scaffolders regularly work on challenging sites including sloped gardens, coastal properties in Brighton and Hastings, and urban locations with restricted access. We use adjustable base plates, stabilizers, and specialist foundations where needed."
  - question: "What insurance do you carry for access scaffolding?"
    answer: "We hold £10 million public liability insurance, employers' liability cover, and professional indemnity insurance. We're also CHAS and Constructionline accredited, meeting the insurance requirements for residential, commercial, and local authority contracts."
  - question: "Will access scaffolding damage my property or garden?"
    answer: "We take extensive precautions to protect your property. We use protective boards under scaffolding feet, cover driveways and patios, and can install boardwalks to distribute weight. Our experienced teams minimize ground disturbance and restore areas after dismantling."

  - question: "How much does scaffolding cost per week in Sussex?"
    answer: "Scaffolding hire rates typically range from £200-£500 per week depending on the size and complexity of your project. Factors affecting cost include scaffold height, access requirements, and hire duration. We provide free, detailed quotes tailored to your specific needs."
  - question: "How long does scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can be erected in 4-8 hours, while commercial projects may take 1-3 days. We schedule installations to minimise disruption and can often complete same-day setup for standard domestic projects."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding?"
    answer: "Scaffolding on private property typically doesn't require planning permission. However, if scaffolding extends onto public pavements or highways, you'll need a licence from the local council. We handle all necessary permits and licences on your behalf."
