faqs:
  - question: "What is edge protection and when is it legally required?"
    answer: "Edge protection is a safety system using guardrails, toe boards, and barriers to prevent falls from roofs, slabs, and elevated edges. It's legally required under the Work at Height Regulations 2005 for any work where there's a fall risk of 2 meters or more."
  - question: "What types of edge protection systems do you offer?"
    answer: "We provide temporary guardrail systems, roof edge barriers, parapet clamps, freestanding edge protection, and integrated scaffold edge protection. All systems are designed to meet HSE standards and can be adapted to most roof types and structures."
  - question: "How quickly can you install edge protection?"
    answer: "For standard residential roofs, we can typically install within 24 hours. Larger commercial buildings may take 1-3 days depending on the roof area and complexity. Emergency installations can often be arranged same-day."
  - question: "Can edge protection be installed on fragile roofs?"
    answer: "Yes. We specialize in edge protection for fragile roofs including corrugated sheets, asbestos cement, and skylights. We use counterweighted systems and proper load distribution to avoid penetrating or stressing fragile roof materials."
  - question: "Is edge protection required for all roof work?"
    answer: "By law, collective fall protection like edge protection must be used wherever reasonably practicable. It's the preferred method over personal fall arrest systems because it protects everyone on the roof simultaneously without requiring individual harnesses."
  - question: "Do you provide edge protection across Sussex and Kent?"
    answer: "Yes, we provide edge protection systems throughout Sussex and Kent, including Brighton, Hastings, Canterbury, and surrounding areas. We're familiar with local building types and regulatory requirements in each region."
  - question: "What insurance do you carry for edge protection work?"
    answer: "We maintain £10 million public liability insurance and are fully CHAS and Constructionline accredited. All our edge protection systems are installed by CITB-trained professionals and meet current HSE guidelines."

  - question: "How much does scaffolding cost per week in Sussex?"
    answer: "Scaffolding hire rates typically range from £200-£500 per week depending on the size and complexity of your project. Factors affecting cost include scaffold height, access requirements, and hire duration. We provide free, detailed quotes tailored to your specific needs."
  - question: "How long does scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can be erected in 4-8 hours, while commercial projects may take 1-3 days. We schedule installations to minimise disruption and can often complete same-day setup for standard domestic projects."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding?"
    answer: "Scaffolding on private property typically doesn't require planning permission. However, if scaffolding extends onto public pavements or highways, you'll need a licence from the local council. We handle all necessary permits and licences on your behalf."
