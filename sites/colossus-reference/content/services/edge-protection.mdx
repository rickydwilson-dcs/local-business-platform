faqs:
  - question: "What is edge protection and when is it legally required?"
    answer: "Edge protection is a safety system using guardrails, toe boards, and barriers to prevent falls from roofs, slabs, and elevated edges. It's legally required under the Work at Height Regulations 2005 for any work where there's a fall risk of 2 meters or more."
  - question: "What types of edge protection systems do you offer?"
    answer: "We provide temporary guardrail systems, roof edge barriers, parapet clamps, freestanding edge protection, and integrated scaffold edge protection. All systems are designed to meet HSE standards and can be adapted to most roof types and structures."
  - question: "How quickly can you install edge protection?"
    answer: "For standard residential roofs, we can typically install within 24 hours. Larger commercial buildings may take 1-3 days depending on the roof area and complexity. Emergency installations can often be arranged same-day."
  - question: "Can edge protection be installed on fragile roofs?"
    answer: "Yes. We specialize in edge protection for fragile roofs including corrugated sheets, asbestos cement, and skylights. We use counterweighted systems and proper load distribution to avoid penetrating or stressing fragile roof materials."
  - question: "Is edge protection required for all roof work?"
    answer: "By law, collective fall protection like edge protection must be used wherever reasonably practicable. It's the preferred method over personal fall arrest systems because it protects everyone on the roof simultaneously without requiring individual harnesses."
