faqs:
  - question: "What is a pavement gantry and when is it needed?"
    answer: "A pavement gantry is a protective structure that allows pedestrians to walk safely beneath scaffolding or construction work. It's legally required when scaffolding obstructs public footpaths, ensuring pedestrian safety while maintaining public access during construction."
  - question: "Do I need council permission for a pavement gantry?"
    answer: "Yes. Pavement gantries require highway authority licenses from local councils. We manage the entire application process including structural drawings, insurance documentation, and highway permits for projects across Brighton, Hastings, Canterbury, and throughout Kent and Sussex."
  - question: "How quickly can you install a pavement gantry?"
    answer: "Once highway licenses are approved (typically 2-4 weeks), installation takes 2-5 days depending on gantry length and complexity. We coordinate installation to minimize disruption to businesses and pedestrian traffic."
  - question: "What are loading bays and why are they important?"
    answer: "Loading bays are reinforced platforms designed for safe material handling and goods access on construction sites. They provide controlled access points for deliveries, protecting both workers and the public while maintaining efficient material flow to upper levels."
  - question: "Can pavement gantries support scaffolding loads above?"
    answer: "Yes. All our pavement gantries are engineered to support the full scaffolding loads above, including materials, equipment, and workers. Each gantry includes structural calculations and is designed to meet highway authority requirements for public safety."
  - question: "What lighting and signage is required for pavement gantries?"
    answer: "Pavement gantries must have adequate lighting for night-time pedestrian safety, warning signage, and compliance with highway authority standards. We provide complete installations including lighting, reflective markings, and required safety signage."
  - question: "How wide do pavement gantries need to be?"
    answer: "Minimum clear width is typically 2 meters to comply with Equality Act requirements and allow wheelchair access. Councils may require wider gangways on busy streets. We design gantries to meet all accessibility and safety standards."
  - question: "Can you install temporary loading bays on upper floors?"
    answer: "Yes. We install loading bays at any level, engineered for specific load requirements. These bays provide safe material transfer points, integrate with scaffolding structures, and include all necessary edge protection and access features."

  - question: "How much does scaffolding cost per week in Sussex?"
    answer: "Scaffolding hire rates typically range from £200-£500 per week depending on the size and complexity of your project. Factors affecting cost include scaffold height, access requirements, and hire duration. We provide free, detailed quotes tailored to your specific needs."
  - question: "How long does scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can be erected in 4-8 hours, while commercial projects may take 1-3 days. We schedule installations to minimise disruption and can often complete same-day setup for standard domestic projects."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding?"
    answer: "Scaffolding on private property typically doesn't require planning permission. However, if scaffolding extends onto public pavements or highways, you'll need a licence from the local council. We handle all necessary permits and licences on your behalf."
