faqs:
  - question: "What are staircase towers and when are they used?"
    answer: "Staircase towers are modular scaffold structures featuring integrated stair flights providing safe vertical access. They're used when ladder access is impractical or unsafe, for frequent vertical movement, multi-level access requirements, and where improved safety and efficiency are needed for workers regularly moving between heights."
  - question: "What's the difference between staircase towers and ladder access?"
    answer: "Staircase towers provide safer, easier access with both hands free for carrying tools and materials. They're less tiring for frequent use, suitable for all workers regardless of mobility, and required when risk assessment indicates ladder access is unsuitable for frequency or duration of use."
  - question: "Can staircase towers be used as primary scaffold access?"
    answer: "Yes. Staircase towers can serve as main access routes on scaffolding projects, particularly for commercial and industrial sites where multiple workers need frequent, safe vertical access. They meet HSE guidelines for primary access on construction sites."
  - question: "How high can staircase towers reach?"
    answer: "Staircase towers can be built to significant heights, typically ranging from single-flight domestic applications (3-4 meters) to multi-story commercial installations exceeding 20 meters. Height capability depends on design, base dimensions, and tie requirements."
  - question: "Do staircase towers require design calculations?"
    answer: "Complex or tall staircase towers require structural design, particularly when exceeding standard configurations, serving as primary site access, or in exposed locations like coastal Brighton and Hastings. We provide full engineering documentation when required."
  - question: "Can staircase towers be relocated during a project?"
    answer: "Yes. Modular staircase towers can be dismantled and relocated as work progresses, providing flexible access solutions that adapt to changing project phases. This makes them cost-effective for phased works requiring access at different locations."
  - question: "Are staircase towers suitable for public or client access?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Staircase towers provide dignified, safe access suitable for site visitors, clients, building control inspectors, and others who need occasional site access but may not be comfortable with ladder climbing."
  - question: "What ground conditions are needed for staircase towers?"
    answer: "Staircase towers require firm, level ground with adequate load-bearing capacity. Base plates distribute loads, but soft or uneven ground may need sole boards, concrete pads, or engineered foundations. We assess ground conditions during site surveys."

  - question: "How much does scaffolding cost per week in Sussex?"
    answer: "Scaffolding hire rates typically range from £200-£500 per week depending on the size and complexity of your project. Factors affecting cost include scaffold height, access requirements, and hire duration. We provide free, detailed quotes tailored to your specific needs."
  - question: "How long does scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can be erected in 4-8 hours, while commercial projects may take 1-3 days. We schedule installations to minimise disruption and can often complete same-day setup for standard domestic projects."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding?"
    answer: "Scaffolding on private property typically doesn't require planning permission. However, if scaffolding extends onto public pavements or highways, you'll need a licence from the local council. We handle all necessary permits and licences on your behalf."
