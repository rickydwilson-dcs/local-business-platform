about:
  whatIs: "Staircase towers are modular scaffold structures featuring integrated stair flights that provide safe, hands-free vertical access on construction sites. Designed to BS EN 12811-1 and TG20:21 standards, these temporary access solutions support loads of 2.0-3.0 kN/m2 on stair treads and landings. Standard configurations feature 500mm or 600mm wide flights with 150-200mm rise per step, meeting CDM Regulations 2015 requirements for safe means of access and egress."
  whenNeeded:
    - "Multi-level construction sites requiring frequent vertical access"
    - "Commercial projects where ladder access fails risk assessment"
    - "Sites with workers carrying tools or materials between levels"
    - "Primary access routes where HSE guidelines recommend stair access"
    - "Projects requiring visitor or client access to elevated areas"
    - "Industrial sites with high-frequency worker movement"
    - "Phased works requiring relocatable access solutions"
    - "Sites where worker fatigue from ladder climbing is a concern"
  whatAchieve:
    - "Safe hands-free vertical access up to 30+ metres"
    - "Load capacity supporting workers with tools and materials"
    - "HSE and CDM Regulations 2015 compliance"
    - "Reduced worker fatigue compared to ladder access"
    - "Suitable access for all worker abilities and fitness levels"
    - "Modular design allowing relocation as projects progress"
    - "Integration with scaffold working platforms"
  keyPoints:
    - "BS EN 12811-1 stair and landing design compliance"
    - "TG20:21 structural design where applicable"
    - "CISRS qualified installation teams"
    - "Modular components for flexibility and relocation"
    - "Integrated handrails and edge protection"
faqs:
  - question: "What are staircase towers and when are they used?"
    answer: "Staircase towers are modular scaffold structures featuring integrated stair flights providing safe vertical access. They're used when ladder access is impractical or unsafe, for frequent vertical movement, multi-level access requirements, and where improved safety and efficiency are needed for workers regularly moving between heights."
  - question: "What's the difference between staircase towers and ladder access?"
    answer: "Staircase towers provide safer, easier access with both hands free for carrying tools and materials. They're less tiring for frequent use, suitable for all workers regardless of mobility, and required when risk assessment indicates ladder access is unsuitable for frequency or duration of use."
  - question: "Can staircase towers be used as primary scaffold access?"
    answer: "Yes. Staircase towers can serve as main access routes on scaffolding projects, particularly for commercial and industrial sites where multiple workers need frequent, safe vertical access. They meet HSE guidelines for primary access on construction sites."
  - question: "How high can staircase towers reach?"
    answer: "Staircase towers can be built to significant heights, typically ranging from single-flight domestic applications (3-4 meters) to multi-story commercial installations exceeding 20 meters. Height capability depends on design, base dimensions, and tie requirements."
  - question: "Do staircase towers require design calculations?"
    answer: "Complex or tall staircase towers require structural design, particularly when exceeding standard configurations, serving as primary site access, or in exposed locations like coastal Brighton and Hastings. We provide full engineering documentation when required."
  - question: "Can staircase towers be relocated during a project?"
    answer: "Yes. Modular staircase towers can be dismantled and relocated as work progresses, providing flexible access solutions that adapt to changing project phases. This makes them cost-effective for phased works requiring access at different locations."
  - question: "Are staircase towers suitable for public or client access?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Staircase towers provide dignified, safe access suitable for site visitors, clients, building control inspectors, and others who need occasional site access but may not be comfortable with ladder climbing."
  - question: "What ground conditions are needed for staircase towers?"
    answer: "Staircase towers require firm, level ground with adequate load-bearing capacity. Base plates distribute loads, but soft or uneven ground may need sole boards, concrete pads, or engineered foundations. We assess ground conditions during site surveys."

  - question: "How much do staircase towers cost to hire?"
    answer: "Staircase tower hire typically ranges from £150-£400 per week depending on height and configuration. Single-flight domestic installations start around £150/week, while multi-story commercial staircase towers can exceed £300/week. Installation and dismantling are charged separately. We provide detailed quotes based on your specific access requirements."
  - question: "How quickly can staircase towers be installed?"
    answer: "Standard staircase towers can typically be installed in 4-8 hours. Multi-story configurations for commercial sites may take 1-2 days. Installation time depends on tower height, ground conditions, and integration requirements with existing scaffolding."
  - question: "Can staircase towers be integrated with existing scaffolding?"
    answer: "Yes, staircase towers can be designed to integrate with existing scaffold structures, providing upgraded access where ladder access has proven inadequate. Integration requires assessment of the existing scaffold design and may need additional ties or structural modifications to accommodate the tower loads."
