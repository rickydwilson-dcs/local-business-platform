about:
  whatIs: "Scaffolding inspections and maintenance are statutory safety services ensuring working platforms remain compliant and safe throughout project duration. Under the Work at Height Regulations 2005 and Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015, all scaffolds must be inspected before first use, at maximum 7-day intervals, and after any event that could affect structural integrity. Our inspection services meet NASC SG4:15 guidance and TG20:21 compliance requirements."

    - "Following any modifications or alterations to scaffold structure"
    - "After any event potentially affecting stability (impact, subsidence)"
    - "Before resuming work after extended periods of inactivity"
    - "For insurance and HSE compliance verification"

    - "Peace of mind that working platforms are safe for personnel"
    - "Protection from enforcement action and prosecution"
  keyPoints:
    - "CISRS Advanced Scaffolders and qualified inspectors"

    - "Same-day emergency inspection availability"
    - "Integrated maintenance and repair service"
faqs:
  - question: "How often must scaffolding be inspected by law?"
    answer: "UK law requires scaffold inspections before first use (handover inspection), then at least every 7 days, after any modifications, after adverse weather conditions (storms, high winds), and after any event that could affect scaffold stability or safety."
  - question: "What's included in a scaffold handover certificate?"
    answer: "Handover certificates confirm the scaffold meets design specifications, is safe for use, and complies with regulations. They include inspection findings, load ratings, any limitations on use, inspector qualifications, and certification that the scaffold is ready for handover to the client."
  - question: "Who can carry out scaffold inspections?"
    answer: "Inspections must be conducted by competent persons with specific scaffolding knowledge and experience. Our inspectors are CISRS Advanced Scaffolders or qualified scaffold inspectors with extensive training in scaffold safety, structural integrity assessment, and regulatory compliance."
  - question: "What happens if a scaffold fails inspection?"
    answer: "Failed inspections result in immediate tagging as unsafe until repairs are completed. We provide rapid response maintenance to address any deficiencies, re-inspect after repairs, and issue updated certification once the scaffold meets all safety standards."
  - question: "Do you provide inspection services for scaffolds erected by others?"
    answer: "Yes. We offer independent inspection services for scaffolding installed by any contractor across Sussex and Kent. This includes weekly inspections, post-storm checks, pre-use inspections, and compliance verification for insurance and regulatory requirements."
  - question: "What maintenance is required during scaffold hire?"
    answer: "Regular maintenance includes checking tie integrity, replacing damaged boards or components, ensuring edge protection remains secure, clearing debris, and monitoring ground conditions. We provide ongoing maintenance services throughout your hire period to maintain safety and compliance."
  - question: "How are inspection records kept and who needs copies?"
    answer: "All inspections are documented with written reports retained on site and copies provided to clients, principal contractors, and retained for legal compliance periods. Digital copies are available, and reports must be available for HSE inspection at any time."
  - question: "What qualifies as 'adverse weather' requiring an inspection?"
    answer: "Adverse weather includes storms, winds exceeding 40mph, heavy snow or ice accumulation, flooding, or any weather event that could affect scaffold stability. Coastal locations like Brighton and Hastings may require more frequent post-weather inspections due to exposure."

  - question: "How much do scaffold inspection services cost?"
    answer: "Inspection costs vary based on scaffold size and complexity. Standard 7-day inspections typically range from £75-£150 per visit, while comprehensive handover inspections for larger structures may cost £200-£400. We offer inspection packages for long-term projects that reduce per-visit costs."
  - question: "What are the legal penalties for inadequate scaffold inspections?"
    answer: "Failure to maintain proper scaffold inspections can result in HSE enforcement notices, prohibition orders halting work, and prosecution under the Work at Height Regulations 2005. Penalties can include unlimited fines and imprisonment for serious breaches. Proper inspection records provide essential legal protection."
  - question: "Can you inspect scaffolds erected by other contractors?"
    answer: "Yes, we provide independent inspection services for scaffolding installed by any contractor across Sussex and Kent. This includes statutory 7-day inspections, handover certification, post-weather checks, and compliance audits. Independent inspection provides additional assurance and can satisfy client or insurance requirements."
