faqs:
  - question: "How often must scaffolding be inspected by law?"
    answer: "UK law requires scaffold inspections before first use (handover inspection), then at least every 7 days, after any modifications, after adverse weather conditions (storms, high winds), and after any event that could affect scaffold stability or safety."
  - question: "What's included in a scaffold handover certificate?"
    answer: "Handover certificates confirm the scaffold meets design specifications, is safe for use, and complies with regulations. They include inspection findings, load ratings, any limitations on use, inspector qualifications, and certification that the scaffold is ready for handover to the client."
  - question: "Who can carry out scaffold inspections?"
    answer: "Inspections must be conducted by competent persons with specific scaffolding knowledge and experience. Our inspectors are CISRS Advanced Scaffolders or qualified scaffold inspectors with extensive training in scaffold safety, structural integrity assessment, and regulatory compliance."
  - question: "What happens if a scaffold fails inspection?"
    answer: "Failed inspections result in immediate tagging as unsafe until repairs are completed. We provide rapid response maintenance to address any deficiencies, re-inspect after repairs, and issue updated certification once the scaffold meets all safety standards."
  - question: "Do you provide inspection services for scaffolds erected by others?"
    answer: "Yes. We offer independent inspection services for scaffolding installed by any contractor across Sussex and Kent. This includes weekly inspections, post-storm checks, pre-use inspections, and compliance verification for insurance and regulatory requirements."
  - question: "What maintenance is required during scaffold hire?"
    answer: "Regular maintenance includes checking tie integrity, replacing damaged boards or components, ensuring edge protection remains secure, clearing debris, and monitoring ground conditions. We provide ongoing maintenance services throughout your hire period to maintain safety and compliance."
  - question: "How are inspection records kept and who needs copies?"
    answer: "All inspections are documented with written reports retained on site and copies provided to clients, principal contractors, and retained for legal compliance periods. Digital copies are available, and reports must be available for HSE inspection at any time."
  - question: "What qualifies as 'adverse weather' requiring an inspection?"
    answer: "Adverse weather includes storms, winds exceeding 40mph, heavy snow or ice accumulation, flooding, or any weather event that could affect scaffold stability. Coastal locations like Brighton and Hastings may require more frequent post-weather inspections due to exposure."

  - question: "How much does scaffolding cost per week in Sussex?"
    answer: "Scaffolding hire rates typically range from £200-£500 per week depending on the size and complexity of your project. Factors affecting cost include scaffold height, access requirements, and hire duration. We provide free, detailed quotes tailored to your specific needs."
  - question: "How long does scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can be erected in 4-8 hours, while commercial projects may take 1-3 days. We schedule installations to minimise disruption and can often complete same-day setup for standard domestic projects."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding?"
    answer: "Scaffolding on private property typically doesn't require planning permission. However, if scaffolding extends onto public pavements or highways, you'll need a licence from the local council. We handle all necessary permits and licences on your behalf."
