faqs:
  - question: "When is scaffolding design and engineering required?"
    answer: "Design calculations are legally required for scaffolds exceeding TG20:21 parameters, including heavy-duty load-bearing structures, complex configurations, unusual heights or spans, scaffolds on weak ground, and any scaffold requiring specific load capacity verification for insurance or regulatory compliance."
  - question: "What's included in scaffold design drawings?"
    answer: "Professional scaffold design includes structural calculations, general arrangement drawings, detail drawings showing connections and loading, tie patterns, foundation requirements, load specifications, and engineer's certification. All designs meet BS 5975 temporary works standards."
  - question: "How long does it take to produce scaffold designs?"
    answer: "Standard designs typically take 3-5 working days. Complex industrial or bespoke structures may require 7-14 days. Urgent designs can be fast-tracked for emergency situations. Design timelines are confirmed during initial consultation."
  - question: "Do I need scaffold designs for building control or planning?"
    answer: "Many building control departments, particularly for complex projects or heritage sites in Canterbury and Brighton, require engineered scaffold designs. Planning applications for significant structures may also need design documentation. We provide all necessary drawings formatted for regulatory submissions."
  - question: "Who produces your scaffold designs?"
    answer: "All designs are produced by qualified temporary works engineers with specific scaffolding design expertise. Our engineers hold appropriate professional qualifications and design to BS 5975, HSE guidance, and NASC standards."
  - question: "Can you design scaffolding for unusual or challenging sites?"
    answer: "Yes. We specialize in bespoke designs for challenging scenarios including unstable ground, heritage buildings in Canterbury and Hastings, coastal exposure, confined spaces, live railway environments, and complex industrial plants requiring specialized access solutions."
  - question: "What happens if site conditions differ from the design?"
    answer: "Any deviation from design requires immediate notification. We provide rapid design revisions to accommodate changed ground conditions, unforeseen obstacles, or modified project requirements, ensuring continued compliance and safety throughout your project."
  - question: "Do design drawings satisfy insurance requirements?"
    answer: "Yes. Our engineered designs meet insurance requirements for complex scaffolding projects. Designs include professional indemnity coverage and provide the documentation insurers require for policy compliance on projects requiring engineered temporary works."

  - question: "How much does scaffolding cost per week in Sussex?"
    answer: "Scaffolding hire rates typically range from £200-£500 per week depending on the size and complexity of your project. Factors affecting cost include scaffold height, access requirements, and hire duration. We provide free, detailed quotes tailored to your specific needs."
  - question: "How long does scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can be erected in 4-8 hours, while commercial projects may take 1-3 days. We schedule installations to minimise disruption and can often complete same-day setup for standard domestic projects."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding?"
    answer: "Scaffolding on private property typically doesn't require planning permission. However, if scaffolding extends onto public pavements or highways, you'll need a licence from the local council. We handle all necessary permits and licences on your behalf."
