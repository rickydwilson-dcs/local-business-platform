about:
  whatIs: "Scaffolding design and drawings provide the engineering foundation for complex temporary works, ensuring structural integrity and regulatory compliance. Professional temporary works design to BS 5975:2019 includes structural calculations, general arrangement drawings, detailed connection specifications, and tie pattern documentation. Design is legally required when scaffolds exceed TG20:21 standard configurations, support heavy loads exceeding 2.0 kN/m2, span unusual distances, or require specific load verification for insurance compliance."
  whenNeeded:
    - "Scaffolds exceeding TG20:21 standard configuration parameters"
    - "Heavy-duty load-bearing scaffolds exceeding 3.0 kN/m2"
    - "Complex geometric configurations and bespoke structures"
    - "Scaffolds on weak or variable ground conditions"
    - "Heritage and conservation sites requiring specialist approval"
    - "Building control submissions for significant structures"
    - "Insurance compliance documentation for major projects"
    - "Suspended scaffolding and cantilever systems"
  whatAchieve:
    - "BS 5975:2019 compliant structural design documentation"
    - "Certified load capacity verification and calculations"
    - "Building control and planning authority acceptance"
    - "Insurance and regulatory compliance evidence"
    - "Risk mitigation through professional engineering"
    - "Clear construction guidance through detailed drawings"
    - "Legal protection through documented design compliance"
  keyPoints:
    - "BS 5975:2019 temporary works design standard"
    - "Chartered or Incorporated Engineer certification"
    - "AutoCAD and Revit drawing production"
    - "Professional indemnity insurance coverage"
    - "Building control liaison and submission support"
faqs:
  - question: "When is scaffolding design and engineering required?"
    answer: "Design calculations are legally required for scaffolds exceeding TG20:21 parameters, including heavy-duty load-bearing structures, complex configurations, unusual heights or spans, scaffolds on weak ground, and any scaffold requiring specific load capacity verification for insurance or regulatory compliance."
  - question: "What's included in scaffold design drawings?"
    answer: "Professional scaffold design includes structural calculations, general arrangement drawings, detail drawings showing connections and loading, tie patterns, foundation requirements, load specifications, and engineer's certification. All designs meet BS 5975 temporary works standards."
  - question: "How long does it take to produce scaffold designs?"
    answer: "Standard designs typically take 3-5 working days. Complex industrial or bespoke structures may require 7-14 days. Urgent designs can be fast-tracked for emergency situations. Design timelines are confirmed during initial consultation."
  - question: "Do I need scaffold designs for building control or planning?"
    answer: "Many building control departments, particularly for complex projects or heritage sites in Canterbury and Brighton, require engineered scaffold designs. Planning applications for significant structures may also need design documentation. We provide all necessary drawings formatted for regulatory submissions."
  - question: "Who produces your scaffold designs?"
    answer: "All designs are produced by qualified temporary works engineers with specific scaffolding design expertise. Our engineers hold appropriate professional qualifications and design to BS 5975, HSE guidance, and NASC standards."
  - question: "Can you design scaffolding for unusual or challenging sites?"
    answer: "Yes. We specialize in bespoke designs for challenging scenarios including unstable ground, heritage buildings in Canterbury and Hastings, coastal exposure, confined spaces, live railway environments, and complex industrial plants requiring specialized access solutions."
  - question: "What happens if site conditions differ from the design?"
    answer: "Any deviation from design requires immediate notification. We provide rapid design revisions to accommodate changed ground conditions, unforeseen obstacles, or modified project requirements, ensuring continued compliance and safety throughout your project."
  - question: "Do design drawings satisfy insurance requirements?"
    answer: "Yes. Our engineered designs meet insurance requirements for complex scaffolding projects. Designs include professional indemnity coverage and provide the documentation insurers require for policy compliance on projects requiring engineered temporary works."

  - question: "How much do scaffolding design services cost?"
    answer: "Scaffold design costs range from £500-£800 for standard bespoke designs to £2,000-£5,000+ for complex industrial structures. Costs depend on scaffold complexity, load requirements, and urgency. Design fees include structural calculations, drawings, and engineer certification. We provide fixed-price quotes after initial consultation."
  - question: "What qualifications should scaffold design engineers have?"
    answer: "Scaffold design should be carried out by engineers with specific temporary works expertise. Our engineers hold Chartered (CEng) or Incorporated (IEng) status with ICE, IStructE, or equivalent institutions, along with practical scaffolding design experience and BS 5975 competency."
  - question: "Can you provide design revisions during a project?"
    answer: "Yes, design revisions are a normal part of complex projects. Site conditions, client requirements, or unforeseen circumstances may require design modifications. We provide responsive revision services to maintain compliance and safety as projects evolve, with rapid turnaround for urgent changes."
