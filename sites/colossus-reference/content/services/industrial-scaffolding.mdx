about:
  whatIs: "Industrial scaffolding is a heavy-duty temporary access system engineered for manufacturing plants, processing facilities, and industrial infrastructure. Our TG20:21 compliant industrial scaffolding is designed to handle extreme loads, complex configurations, and hazardous environments while meeting stringent industry-specific safety standards including COMAH and DSEAR requirements."
  whenNeeded:
    - "Factory maintenance shutdowns"
    - "Manufacturing plant expansions"
    - "Petrochemical facility access"
    - "Power station repairs"
    - "Water treatment works"
    - "Heavy engineering projects"
    - "Infrastructure developments"
    - "Emergency industrial repairs"
  whatAchieve:
    - "Safe access in hazardous environments"
    - "Heavy-duty load capacity (750kg/m²)"
    - "Compliance with industrial regulations"
    - "Coordination with production schedules"
    - "Specialist confined space access"
    - "Chemical-resistant materials"
    - "24/7 emergency support"
  keyPoints:
    - "Advanced CISRS certified industrial teams"
    - "COMAH and DSEAR compliant operations"
    - "Shutdown coordination expertise"
    - "Heavy-duty load engineering"
faqs:
  - question: "What qualifies as industrial scaffolding versus commercial or residential?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding is designed for heavy manufacturing, processing plants, power generation facilities, refineries, chemical plants, and infrastructure projects. It requires extreme load-bearing capacity, specialist engineering, and compliance with industry-specific safety standards."
  - question: "What types of industrial projects require specialist scaffolding?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding serves factory maintenance shutdowns, manufacturing plant expansions, petrochemical facility access, power station repairs, water treatment works, heavy engineering projects, and large-scale infrastructure developments."
  - question: "What are the key differences between industrial and standard scaffolding?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding features higher load capacities (often 750kg/m² vs 200kg/m²), more robust engineering, specialist materials resistant to chemicals and extreme temperatures, and compliance with industry-specific regulations like COMAH and DSEAR."
  - question: "How much does industrial scaffolding typically cost?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding projects vary from £15,000 for small plant maintenance to £500,000+ for major facility shutdowns. Costs reflect complex engineering requirements, heavy-duty materials, and specialist certifications."
  - question: "What timeline is typical for industrial scaffolding projects?"
    answer: "Industrial projects range from 1-2 weeks for small plant maintenance to 3-6 months for major facility shutdowns. Planning typically begins months in advance to coordinate with production schedules."
  - question: "What specialist certifications are needed for industrial work?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding requires Advanced Scaffolder CISRS certification, specialist engineering qualifications (SG4:15 compliance), confined space training, NEBOSH certification, and often client-specific inductions for high-hazard environments."
  - question: "How is safety managed in hazardous industrial environments?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding follows rigorous protocols including HAZOP assessments, permit-to-work systems, confined space procedures, hot work permits, chemical compatibility checks, and explosion risk assessments for ATEX zones."
  - question: "What are common challenges with industrial scaffolding installations?"
    answer: "Industrial challenges include working around operational equipment, managing extreme temperatures and chemical exposure, coordinating with shutdown windows, ensuring continuous production access, and meeting stringent industry regulations."
  - question: "How much does scaffolding cost per week in Sussex?"
    answer: "Scaffolding hire rates typically range from £200-£500 per week depending on the size and complexity of your project. Factors affecting cost include scaffold height, access requirements, and hire duration. We provide free, detailed quotes tailored to your specific needs."
  - question: "How long does scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can be erected in 4-8 hours, while commercial projects may take 1-3 days. We schedule installations to minimise disruption and can often complete same-day setup for standard domestic projects."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding?"
    answer: "Scaffolding on private property typically doesn't require planning permission. However, if scaffolding extends onto public pavements or highways, you'll need a licence from the local council. We handle all necessary permits and licences on your behalf."
