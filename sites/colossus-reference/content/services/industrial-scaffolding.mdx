about:
  whatIs: "Industrial scaffolding is a heavy-duty temporary access system engineered for manufacturing plants, processing facilities, and industrial infrastructure. Our TG20:21 compliant industrial scaffolding is designed to handle extreme loads, complex configurations, and hazardous environments while meeting stringent industry-specific safety standards including COMAH and DSEAR requirements."
  whenNeeded:
    - "Factory maintenance shutdowns"
    - "Manufacturing plant expansions"
    - "Petrochemical facility access"
    - "Power station repairs"
    - "Water treatment works"
    - "Heavy engineering projects"
    - "Infrastructure developments"
    - "Emergency industrial repairs"
  whatAchieve:
    - "Safe access in hazardous environments"
    - "Heavy-duty load capacity (750kg/m²)"
    - "Compliance with industrial regulations"
    - "Coordination with production schedules"
    - "Specialist confined space access"
    - "Chemical-resistant materials"
    - "24/7 emergency support"
  keyPoints:
    - "Advanced CISRS certified industrial teams"
    - "COMAH and DSEAR compliant operations"
    - "Shutdown coordination expertise"
    - "Heavy-duty load engineering"
faqs:
  - question: "What qualifies as industrial scaffolding versus commercial or residential?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding is designed for heavy manufacturing, processing plants, power generation facilities, refineries, chemical plants, and infrastructure projects. It requires extreme load-bearing capacity, specialist engineering, and compliance with industry-specific safety standards."
  - question: "What types of industrial projects require specialist scaffolding?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding serves factory maintenance shutdowns, manufacturing plant expansions, petrochemical facility access, power station repairs, water treatment works, heavy engineering projects, and large-scale infrastructure developments."
  - question: "What are the key differences between industrial and standard scaffolding?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding features higher load capacities (often 750kg/m² vs 200kg/m²), more robust engineering, specialist materials resistant to chemicals and extreme temperatures, and compliance with industry-specific regulations like COMAH and DSEAR."
  - question: "How much does industrial scaffolding typically cost?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding projects vary from £15,000 for small plant maintenance to £500,000+ for major facility shutdowns. Costs reflect complex engineering requirements, heavy-duty materials, and specialist certifications."
  - question: "What timeline is typical for industrial scaffolding projects?"
    answer: "Industrial projects range from 1-2 weeks for small plant maintenance to 3-6 months for major facility shutdowns. Planning typically begins months in advance to coordinate with production schedules."
  - question: "What specialist certifications are needed for industrial work?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding requires Advanced Scaffolder CISRS certification, specialist engineering qualifications (SG4:15 compliance), confined space training, NEBOSH certification, and often client-specific inductions for high-hazard environments."
  - question: "How is safety managed in hazardous industrial environments?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding follows rigorous protocols including HAZOP assessments, permit-to-work systems, confined space procedures, hot work permits, chemical compatibility checks, and explosion risk assessments for ATEX zones."
  - question: "What are common challenges with industrial scaffolding installations?"
    answer: "Industrial challenges include working around operational equipment, managing extreme temperatures and chemical exposure, coordinating with shutdown windows, ensuring continuous production access, and meeting stringent industry regulations."
  - question: "What are typical costs for industrial scaffolding projects?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding projects typically range from £15,000 for small plant maintenance access to £500,000+ for major facility shutdowns. Costs reflect heavy-duty engineering requirements, specialized materials, COMAH/DSEAR compliance, and extended installation periods. We provide detailed project quotations based on load requirements, duration, and safety specifications."
  - question: "How long does industrial scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding timelines depend on project complexity and facility access restrictions. Plant maintenance access typically requires 1-2 weeks installation, while major shutdown scaffolding may take 4-8 weeks. Our teams coordinate with production schedules and can fast-track emergency installations within 48-72 hours when required."
  - question: "What permits and certifications are required for industrial scaffolding?"
    answer: "Industrial scaffolding requires comprehensive documentation including temporary works design certification, method statements, permit-to-work integration, COMAH notification for upper-tier sites, and often client-specific inductions. We manage all engineering certifications, LOLER compliance for lifting operations, and regulatory submissions."
