faqs:
  - question: "What's the difference between crash decks and crane decks?"
    answer: "Crash decks are protective platforms designed to catch falling objects and protect workers or pedestrians below. Crane decks are reinforced loading platforms engineered to support heavy materials, equipment, and crane operations. Both provide critical safety but serve different primary functions."
  - question: "When is a crash deck legally required on construction sites?"
    answer: "Crash decks are required under CDM Regulations when there's a risk of falling objects endangering people below. They're essential on multi-story construction, refurbishment projects, and any site where work overhead poses a falling object hazard to ground-level workers or the public."
  - question: "What weight can your crane decks support?"
    answer: "Our crane decks are engineered for specific load requirements, typically ranging from 2 to 10 tonnes per square meter. Each installation is designed with structural calculations to safely accommodate your crane operations, material storage, and equipment positioning needs."
  - question: "Can crash decks protect pedestrians on busy streets?"
    answer: "Yes. We install crash decks on urban construction sites throughout Brighton, Canterbury, and Hastings to protect pedestrians walking beneath scaffolding. These protective structures allow safe public access while construction continues overhead, maintaining business and foot traffic flow."
  - question: "How quickly can crash decks or crane decks be installed?"
    answer: "Installation varies by size and complexity. Standard crash decks for residential projects take 1-2 days, while large commercial crane decks may require 3-5 days including structural calculations and engineering certification."
  - question: "Do crane decks require structural design calculations?"
    answer: "Yes. All crane decks require engineering design to ensure safe load-bearing capacity. We provide full structural calculations, design drawings, and certification as part of our crane deck installation service, ensuring HSE and insurance compliance."
  - question: "Can crash decks be installed on scaffolding at any height?"
    answer: "Crash decks can be installed at multiple levels on scaffolding structures. Common installation heights are at first lift (around 2-3 meters) or mid-height positions, depending on the work activities and falling object risks identified in your risk assessment."
  - question: "What insurance documentation do you provide for crash and crane decks?"
    answer: "We provide full structural certification, load calculation documentation, handover certificates, and insurance-compliant inspection records. Our £10 million public liability insurance covers all crash deck and crane deck installations across Sussex and Kent."

  - question: "How much do crash decks and crane decks cost?"
    answer: "Crash deck costs depend on area coverage and project duration, typically £500-£2,000 for residential sites and £2,000-£10,000+ for commercial projects. Crane decks require bespoke engineering and are quoted based on load requirements and complexity. We provide detailed quotations following site surveys."
  - question: "How are crash decks and crane decks inspected and maintained?"
    answer: "All crash and crane decks are inspected before handover and at 7-day intervals during use. Crane decks receive additional load verification before crane operations. We provide full inspection records and can arrange additional checks before specific heavy lift operations."
  - question: "Can crash decks be retrofitted to existing scaffolding?"
    answer: "Yes, crash decks can be installed on existing scaffold structures where additional falling object protection is required. Retrofitting requires assessment of the existing scaffold design to ensure adequate support. We can integrate crash decks into scaffolds erected by other contractors."
