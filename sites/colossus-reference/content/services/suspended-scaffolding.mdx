about:
  whatIs: "Suspended scaffolding is an aerial working platform system hung from overhead structures using wire ropes, chains, or rigid hangers rather than built from ground level. Engineered to BS EN 1808:2015 and TG20:21 standards, these temporary access solutions provide stable working platforms at heights where ground-based scaffolding is impractical or impossible. Systems typically support loads of 1.5-3.0 kN/m2 and can be configured as single-point, two-point (swing stage), or multi-point platforms depending on project requirements."
  whenNeeded:
    - "Bridge inspection and maintenance requiring underside access"
    - "Pier and jetty structural repairs below deck level"
    - "Building facade work where ground access is obstructed by water or terrain"
    - "Cliff face stabilization and coastal erosion protection works"
    - "Power station cooling tower interior access and maintenance"
    - "Dam and reservoir infrastructure inspection"
    - "Offshore platform maintenance and inspection operations"
    - "High-rise building exterior maintenance where ground scaffolding is impractical"
  whatAchieve:
    - "Safe access to structures 50-200m above ground or water"
    - "Load capacity from 250kg to 1,500kg per platform"
    - "Weather-resistant operation in wind speeds up to 35mph"
    - "Integration with fall arrest systems meeting BS 8437"
    - "Reduced project costs compared to full-height ground scaffolding"
    - "Minimal environmental impact on protected coastal and marine areas"
    - "Compliant operation within marine exclusion zones"
  keyPoints:
    - "BS EN 1808:2015 suspended access equipment compliance"
    - "LOLER 1998 lifting equipment certification"
    - "CISRS Advanced scaffolder qualifications required"
    - "Structural engineer certification for all suspension points"
    - "Redundant safety systems with emergency descent capability"
faqs:
  - question: "What is suspended scaffolding and when is it used?"
    answer: "Suspended scaffolding is a working platform hung from above rather than built from ground level. It's used for bridge work, pier and marine structures, building undersides, locations where ground access is impossible, and situations where traditional scaffolding would be impractical or prohibitively expensive."
  - question: "Is suspended scaffolding safe?"
    answer: "Yes, when properly designed and installed. Suspended scaffolds require rigorous engineering calculations, load testing of suspension points, redundant safety systems, and specialist installation by advanced qualified scaffolders. All work meets NASC SG4 guidance and requires detailed method statements."
  - question: "What types of projects require suspended scaffolding?"
    answer: "Bridge inspections and repairs, pier and jetty maintenance, cliff-face work, building facade access where ground scaffolding is impossible, industrial plant undersides, and marine structures. We regularly install suspended systems for infrastructure and coastal projects throughout Sussex and Kent."
  - question: "How is suspended scaffolding different from rope access?"
    answer: "Suspended scaffolding provides stable working platforms for extended periods, suitable for multiple workers with tools and materials. Rope access is for individual technicians performing specific tasks. Suspended scaffolds are chosen when sustained work requires a robust platform rather than individual positioning."
  - question: "What engineering is required for suspended scaffolds?"
    answer: "All suspended scaffolding requires comprehensive structural design including suspension point calculations, platform load capacity, fall arrest systems, and emergency retrieval procedures. Designs must be certified by qualified engineers and approved before installation."
  - question: "Can suspended scaffolding be used in coastal or marine environments?"
    answer: "Yes. We specialize in suspended scaffolding for coastal applications including pier repairs, sea walls, and cliff structures in Brighton, Hastings, and throughout the Sussex coast. Marine-grade materials and enhanced corrosion protection are used for salt-water environments."
  - question: "How long does suspended scaffolding take to install?"
    answer: "Installation varies significantly based on complexity, access challenges, and engineering requirements. Simple suspended platforms may take 2-3 days, while complex bridge or marine installations can require 1-2 weeks including thorough safety testing and certification."
  - question: "What safety systems are included with suspended scaffolding?"
    answer: "Comprehensive safety systems include redundant suspension arrangements, fall arrest anchorage points, guardrails and toe boards, emergency descent systems, load monitoring devices, and regular competent person inspections throughout the installation period."

  - question: "What load capacities do suspended scaffolding platforms support?"
    answer: "Our suspended scaffolding platforms are engineered for working loads from 250kg to 1,500kg depending on configuration. Single-person inspection platforms typically support 250-400kg, while multi-point cradle systems for maintenance crews can support 1,000-1,500kg including tools and materials. All platforms meet BS EN 1808:2015 load requirements."
  - question: "What engineering documentation is provided with suspended scaffolds?"
    answer: "All suspended scaffolding includes comprehensive engineering documentation: structural calculations for suspension points, platform load specifications, fall arrest system certificates, LOLER lifting equipment examination records, emergency retrieval procedures, and method statements approved by qualified engineers."
  - question: "What certifications are required for suspended scaffolding work?"
    answer: "Suspended scaffolding requires BS EN 1808:2015 compliance for the access equipment, LOLER 1998 certification for lifting operations, and installation by CISRS Advanced qualified scaffolders. All suspension points must be certified by a structural engineer, and operatives require specific suspended access training beyond standard scaffolding qualifications."
