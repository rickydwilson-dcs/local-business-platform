faqs:
  - question: "What is suspended scaffolding and when is it used?"
    answer: "Suspended scaffolding is a working platform hung from above rather than built from ground level. It's used for bridge work, pier and marine structures, building undersides, locations where ground access is impossible, and situations where traditional scaffolding would be impractical or prohibitively expensive."
  - question: "Is suspended scaffolding safe?"
    answer: "Yes, when properly designed and installed. Suspended scaffolds require rigorous engineering calculations, load testing of suspension points, redundant safety systems, and specialist installation by advanced qualified scaffolders. All work meets NASC SG4 guidance and requires detailed method statements."
  - question: "What types of projects require suspended scaffolding?"
    answer: "Bridge inspections and repairs, pier and jetty maintenance, cliff-face work, building facade access where ground scaffolding is impossible, industrial plant undersides, and marine structures. We regularly install suspended systems for infrastructure and coastal projects throughout Sussex and Kent."
  - question: "How is suspended scaffolding different from rope access?"
    answer: "Suspended scaffolding provides stable working platforms for extended periods, suitable for multiple workers with tools and materials. Rope access is for individual technicians performing specific tasks. Suspended scaffolds are chosen when sustained work requires a robust platform rather than individual positioning."
  - question: "What engineering is required for suspended scaffolds?"
    answer: "All suspended scaffolding requires comprehensive structural design including suspension point calculations, platform load capacity, fall arrest systems, and emergency retrieval procedures. Designs must be certified by qualified engineers and approved before installation."
  - question: "Can suspended scaffolding be used in coastal or marine environments?"
    answer: "Yes. We specialize in suspended scaffolding for coastal applications including pier repairs, sea walls, and cliff structures in Brighton, Hastings, and throughout the Sussex coast. Marine-grade materials and enhanced corrosion protection are used for salt-water environments."
  - question: "How long does suspended scaffolding take to install?"
    answer: "Installation varies significantly based on complexity, access challenges, and engineering requirements. Simple suspended platforms may take 2-3 days, while complex bridge or marine installations can require 1-2 weeks including thorough safety testing and certification."
  - question: "What safety systems are included with suspended scaffolding?"
    answer: "Comprehensive safety systems include redundant suspension arrangements, fall arrest anchorage points, guardrails and toe boards, emergency descent systems, load monitoring devices, and regular competent person inspections throughout the installation period."

  - question: "How much does scaffolding cost per week in Sussex?"
    answer: "Scaffolding hire rates typically range from £200-£500 per week depending on the size and complexity of your project. Factors affecting cost include scaffold height, access requirements, and hire duration. We provide free, detailed quotes tailored to your specific needs."
  - question: "How long does scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can be erected in 4-8 hours, while commercial projects may take 1-3 days. We schedule installations to minimise disruption and can often complete same-day setup for standard domestic projects."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding?"
    answer: "Scaffolding on private property typically doesn't require planning permission. However, if scaffolding extends onto public pavements or highways, you'll need a licence from the local council. We handle all necessary permits and licences on your behalf."
