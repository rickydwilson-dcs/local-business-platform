about:
  whatIs: "Scaffold sheeting, netting, and encapsulation systems provide essential containment and weather protection for construction projects. Debris netting prevents falling objects reaching public areas, sheeting protects works from weather while containing dust and debris, and full encapsulation creates sealed environments for hazardous material work. All systems are engineered for wind loading to BS EN 12811-1 and fire safety standards, with enhanced specifications for coastal locations where wind exposure exceeds inland sites."
  whenNeeded:
    - "Public-facing scaffolds requiring debris containment for pedestrian safety"
    - "Weather protection enabling year-round external work"
    - "Dust and debris containment for rendering, sandblasting, or demolition"
    - "Asbestos removal requiring full containment and negative pressure"
    - "Industrial grit blasting and spray painting operations"
    - "Heritage restoration with environmental sensitivity requirements"
    - "Lead paint removal and hazardous material handling"
    - "Temperature-controlled environments for specialist finishes"
  whatAchieve:
    - "Public safety compliance preventing falling debris reaching pedestrians"
    - "Weather protection enabling work in wind up to 35mph behind sheeting"
    - "Dust containment meeting environmental protection requirements"
    - "Full HSE compliance for hazardous material containment"
    - "Enhanced tie patterns supporting wind loads up to 1.2 kN/m2"
    - "Fire-retardant materials meeting building regulation requirements"
    - "Extended working seasons through effective weather protection"
  keyPoints:
    - "BS EN 12811-1 compliant containment design"
    - "Wind loading calculations for coastal exposure"
    - "Fire-retardant certified materials"
    - "HSE-compliant encapsulation for hazardous works"
    - "Enhanced tie patterns for sheeted scaffolds"
faqs:
  - question: "What's the difference between sheeting, netting, and encapsulation?"
    answer: "Debris netting prevents falling objects and tools from leaving the scaffold. Scaffold sheeting provides weather protection and dust containment while allowing some airflow. Full encapsulation creates completely sealed environments for specialist works like asbestos removal, grit blasting, or temperature-controlled applications."
  - question: "When is debris netting legally required?"
    answer: "Debris netting is required when there's a risk of materials, tools, or debris falling from height and endangering people below. It's essential for public-facing works, busy streets in Brighton and Canterbury, and any site where falling object hazards exist."
  - question: "Can scaffold sheeting withstand coastal wind conditions?"
    answer: "Yes. Sheeting installed in coastal areas like Brighton and Hastings is engineered with enhanced wind loading calculations, reinforced fixings, and appropriate mesh percentages to balance weather protection with wind resistance, preventing dangerous wind loading on scaffolding structures."
  - question: "What types of work require full scaffold encapsulation?"
    answer: "Full encapsulation is required for asbestos removal, industrial grit blasting, spray painting, lead paint removal, and work requiring environmental control or complete containment of hazardous materials. It creates negative pressure environments preventing contaminant escape."
  - question: "How does sheeting affect scaffold design and engineering?"
    answer: "Sheeting significantly increases wind loading on scaffolding, requiring enhanced tie patterns, additional bracing, and potentially revised structural calculations. All sheeted scaffolds are assessed for wind loading, particularly important for coastal and exposed locations."
  - question: "Can you install temporary sheeting for emergency weather protection?"
    answer: "Yes. We provide emergency sheeting installation for sudden weather protection needs, storm damage situations, or unexpected delays. Emergency sheeting can typically be installed within 24 hours to protect vulnerable building elements or ongoing works."
  - question: "What fire ratings do your sheeting materials have?"
    answer: "Our scaffold sheeting meets relevant fire safety standards with appropriate flame-retardant specifications. Materials are selected based on project requirements, building regulations, and insurance stipulations for your specific application."
  - question: "How is sheeting maintained during long-term projects?"
    answer: "Long-term sheeting requires regular inspections for tears, fixings security, and wind damage, particularly after storms in coastal Sussex and Kent. We provide maintenance services including repairs, replacement, and re-tensioning to ensure continued protection and safety."

  - question: "How much does scaffold sheeting and netting cost?"
    answer: "Debris netting typically adds £3-£8 per square metre to scaffold costs. Scaffold sheeting ranges from £8-£15 per square metre depending on material specification. Full encapsulation for hazardous works is project-specific and includes engineering, sealing, and air handling. We provide detailed quotes based on your specific containment requirements."
  - question: "How quickly can emergency sheeting be installed?"
    answer: "Emergency sheeting for weather protection or urgent containment can typically be installed within 24-48 hours. We maintain stocks of sheeting materials and can mobilise teams at short notice for storm damage protection, unexpected project delays, or urgent containment requirements across Sussex and Kent."
  - question: "What wind speeds can sheeted scaffolds withstand?"
    answer: "Properly engineered sheeted scaffolds can operate safely in winds up to 35mph. Enhanced tie patterns and wind loading calculations ensure stability, with work suspended in higher winds. Coastal locations like Brighton and Hastings require additional engineering consideration for sustained wind exposure."
