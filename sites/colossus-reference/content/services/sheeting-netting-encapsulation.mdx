faqs:
  - question: "What's the difference between sheeting, netting, and encapsulation?"
    answer: "Debris netting prevents falling objects and tools from leaving the scaffold. Scaffold sheeting provides weather protection and dust containment while allowing some airflow. Full encapsulation creates completely sealed environments for specialist works like asbestos removal, grit blasting, or temperature-controlled applications."
  - question: "When is debris netting legally required?"
    answer: "Debris netting is required when there's a risk of materials, tools, or debris falling from height and endangering people below. It's essential for public-facing works, busy streets in Brighton and Canterbury, and any site where falling object hazards exist."
  - question: "Can scaffold sheeting withstand coastal wind conditions?"
    answer: "Yes. Sheeting installed in coastal areas like Brighton and Hastings is engineered with enhanced wind loading calculations, reinforced fixings, and appropriate mesh percentages to balance weather protection with wind resistance, preventing dangerous wind loading on scaffolding structures."
  - question: "What types of work require full scaffold encapsulation?"
    answer: "Full encapsulation is required for asbestos removal, industrial grit blasting, spray painting, lead paint removal, and work requiring environmental control or complete containment of hazardous materials. It creates negative pressure environments preventing contaminant escape."
  - question: "How does sheeting affect scaffold design and engineering?"
    answer: "Sheeting significantly increases wind loading on scaffolding, requiring enhanced tie patterns, additional bracing, and potentially revised structural calculations. All sheeted scaffolds are assessed for wind loading, particularly important for coastal and exposed locations."
  - question: "Can you install temporary sheeting for emergency weather protection?"
    answer: "Yes. We provide emergency sheeting installation for sudden weather protection needs, storm damage situations, or unexpected delays. Emergency sheeting can typically be installed within 24 hours to protect vulnerable building elements or ongoing works."
  - question: "What fire ratings do your sheeting materials have?"
    answer: "Our scaffold sheeting meets relevant fire safety standards with appropriate flame-retardant specifications. Materials are selected based on project requirements, building regulations, and insurance stipulations for your specific application."
  - question: "How is sheeting maintained during long-term projects?"
    answer: "Long-term sheeting requires regular inspections for tears, fixings security, and wind damage, particularly after storms in coastal Sussex and Kent. We provide maintenance services including repairs, replacement, and re-tensioning to ensure continued protection and safety."

  - question: "How much does scaffolding cost per week in Sussex?"
    answer: "Scaffolding hire rates typically range from £200-£500 per week depending on the size and complexity of your project. Factors affecting cost include scaffold height, access requirements, and hire duration. We provide free, detailed quotes tailored to your specific needs."
  - question: "How long does scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can be erected in 4-8 hours, while commercial projects may take 1-3 days. We schedule installations to minimise disruption and can often complete same-day setup for standard domestic projects."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding?"
    answer: "Scaffolding on private property typically doesn't require planning permission. However, if scaffolding extends onto public pavements or highways, you'll need a licence from the local council. We handle all necessary permits and licences on your behalf."
