faqs:
  - question: "What is facade scaffolding and when do I need it?"
    answer: "Facade scaffolding provides full-height access to building exteriors for repairs, rendering, painting, window replacement, or recladding. You'll need it whenever work on your building's facade requires safe working at height beyond ladder access."
  - question: "How much does facade scaffolding cost?"
    answer: "Costs vary based on building height, access complexity, and hire duration. We provide free, no-obligation quotes tailored to your specific project. Contact us for an accurate estimate based on your building's dimensions and requirements."
  - question: "How quickly can you install facade scaffolding?"
    answer: "For standard residential facades, we typically install within 24-48 hours. Larger commercial or complex structures may take 2-5 days. We'll provide a precise timeline during your free survey."
  - question: "Can you erect facade scaffolding on narrow streets or tight spaces?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We regularly work in challenging locations across Brighton, Hastings, and Canterbury, including narrow Victorian streets and medieval lanes. We use specialized equipment and techniques for restricted access areas."
  - question: "Do you handle planning permission and highway licenses?"
    answer: "Yes. If your facade scaffolding extends over public pavements or roads, we manage all highway authority permits and council applications on your behalf, ensuring full regulatory compliance."
  - question: "Will facade scaffolding damage my property or garden?"
    answer: "We use protective boards and ground protection to prevent any damage to driveways, gardens, or building surfaces. Our experienced teams take great care with your property throughout installation and removal."
  - question: "What does TG20:21 compliance mean for facade scaffolding?"
    answer: "TG20:21 is the industry standard for scaffold design and safety. Our facade scaffolds are designed and erected to meet or exceed these specifications, ensuring guaranteed safety and regulatory compliance."
  - question: "Do you provide handover certificates and regular inspections?"
    answer: "Yes. Every facade scaffold is inspected and certified before handover, then inspected at least every 7 days, after adverse weather, or following any modifications throughout your project."

  - question: "How much does scaffolding cost per week in Sussex?"
    answer: "Scaffolding hire rates typically range from £200-£500 per week depending on the size and complexity of your project. Factors affecting cost include scaffold height, access requirements, and hire duration. We provide free, detailed quotes tailored to your specific needs."
  - question: "How long does scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can be erected in 4-8 hours, while commercial projects may take 1-3 days. We schedule installations to minimise disruption and can often complete same-day setup for standard domestic projects."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding?"
    answer: "Scaffolding on private property typically doesn't require planning permission. However, if scaffolding extends onto public pavements or highways, you'll need a licence from the local council. We handle all necessary permits and licences on your behalf."

3. **Engineering Design** - We create a TG20:21 compliant facade scaffold design providing full coverage of the building exterior with appropriate working platforms and access routes.

4. **Permit Applications** - For scaffolding on public highways or pavements, we handle all council permits and highway authority applications.

5. **Comprehensive Quote** - You receive a detailed quotation covering erection, hire period, inspections, weather protection options, and dismantling.
