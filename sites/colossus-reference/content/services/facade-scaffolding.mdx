faqs:
  - question: "What is facade scaffolding and when do I need it?"
    answer: "Facade scaffolding provides full-height access to building exteriors for repairs, rendering, painting, window replacement, or recladding. You'll need it whenever work on your building's facade requires safe working at height beyond ladder access."
  - question: "How much does facade scaffolding cost?"
    answer: "Costs vary based on building height, access complexity, and hire duration. We provide free, no-obligation quotes tailored to your specific project. Contact us for an accurate estimate based on your building's dimensions and requirements."
  - question: "How quickly can you install facade scaffolding?"
    answer: "For standard residential facades, we typically install within 24-48 hours. Larger commercial or complex structures may take 2-5 days. We'll provide a precise timeline during your free survey."
  - question: "Can you erect facade scaffolding on narrow streets or tight spaces?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We regularly work in challenging locations across Brighton, Hastings, and Canterbury, including narrow Victorian streets and medieval lanes. We use specialized equipment and techniques for restricted access areas."
  - question: "Do you handle planning permission and highway licenses?"
    answer: "Yes. If your facade scaffolding extends over public pavements or roads, we manage all highway authority permits and council applications on your behalf, ensuring full regulatory compliance."
  - question: "Will facade scaffolding damage my property or garden?"
    answer: "We use protective boards and ground protection to prevent any damage to driveways, gardens, or building surfaces. Our experienced teams take great care with your property throughout installation and removal."
  - question: "What does TG20:21 compliance mean for facade scaffolding?"
    answer: "TG20:21 is the industry standard for scaffold design and safety. Our facade scaffolds are designed and erected to meet or exceed these specifications, ensuring guaranteed safety and regulatory compliance."
  - question: "Do you provide handover certificates and regular inspections?"
    answer: "Yes. Every facade scaffold is inspected and certified before handover, then inspected at least every 7 days, after adverse weather, or following any modifications throughout your project."
  - question: "What load capacities are available for facade scaffolding?"
    answer: "Facade scaffolding is designed to various load classes: Light Duty (Class 2, 1.5 kN/m2) for inspection and cleaning, General Purpose (Class 3, 2.0 kN/m2) for painting and pointing, Heavy Duty (Class 4, 3.0 kN/m2) for stone repair, and Special/Masonry (Classes 5-6, 4.5-6.0 kN/m2) for heavy rebuilding work."
  - question: "What weather protection options are available with facade scaffolding?"
    answer: "We offer multiple weather protection solutions: debris netting for basic containment, Monarflex sheeting for weather protection during work, and full encapsulation for complete environmental control. All sheeted scaffolds include enhanced wind loading calculations and additional tie patterns for coastal locations."
  - question: "Can facade scaffolding accommodate difficult building shapes?"
    answer: "Yes, facade scaffolding can be configured for complex building geometries including curved facades, stepped elevations, bay windows, and irregular footprints. Our design team creates bespoke solutions using system scaffolding components, with engineering calculations for non-standard configurations."
