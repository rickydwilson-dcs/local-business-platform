## Residential Scaffolding FAQs

**Q: What types of home projects need residential scaffolding?**
A: Residential scaffolding is essential for house extensions, loft conversions, roof repairs and replacements, chimney work, external painting and rendering, window installations, gutter repairs, solar panel fitting, heritage property restoration, and any home improvement requiring safe access above 3 meters or working at height.

**Q: How is residential scaffolding different from commercial scaffolding?**
A: Residential scaffolding is typically smaller scale, designed for single family homes with standard domestic load requirements, focuses on minimizing disruption to family life and neighbors, uses more compact equipment for garden and driveway protection, and involves homeowner-friendly scheduling around family routines rather than business operations.

**Q: How much does scaffolding cost for a typical house?**
A: Residential scaffolding costs vary by house size and project duration. A typical 3-bedroom semi-detached house might cost £800-£1,500 for basic access, while larger properties or complex projects (full house wrap, multiple elevations) can range from £2,000-£5,000. We provide free, no-obligation quotes tailored to your specific home.

**Q: How long can I keep residential scaffolding up?**
A: Most residential scaffolding can remain in place for 8-12 weeks initially, which covers typical home improvement projects. Extensions can usually be arranged for longer projects. Weekly or monthly hire rates are available. We work flexibly to accommodate your builder's schedule and project timeline.

**Q: Do I need planning permission for scaffolding on my house?**
A: Scaffolding itself typically doesn't require planning permission, but you may need a license if it extends onto public highways or pavements. For listed buildings or properties in conservation areas, you should notify local authorities. We handle all necessary permits and licenses on your behalf.

**Q: Will scaffolding damage my garden, driveway, or property?**
A: Professional residential scaffolding uses protective measures including base plates to distribute weight, protective boards for driveways and paving, scaffold socks for walls, and careful positioning to minimize garden disruption. Our teams take special care with flower beds, lawns, and decorative features. Any unavoidable disturbance is discussed beforehand.

**Q: What insurance do I need for residential scaffolding?**
A: Reputable scaffolding companies carry public liability insurance (minimum £10 million) covering any damage or accidents. Homeowners should inform their home insurance provider that scaffolding will be erected, as it can affect security and access. Some insurers require additional security measures when scaffolding provides easy access to upper floors.

**Q: Is residential scaffolding safe for families with children and pets?**
A: Yes, when properly installed by qualified professionals. Safety features include secure fencing at ground level, locked access points to prevent unauthorized climbing, netting or debris netting where appropriate, and clear safety briefings for families. We advise keeping children and pets away during installation and dismantling.

**Q: How much does scaffolding cost per week in Sussex?**
A: Scaffolding hire rates typically range from £200-£500 per week depending on the size and complexity of your project. Factors affecting cost include scaffold height, access requirements, and hire duration. We provide free, detailed quotes tailored to your specific needs.
