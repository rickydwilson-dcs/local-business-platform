faqs:
  - question: "What types of home projects need residential scaffolding?"
    answer: "Residential scaffolding is essential for house extensions, loft conversions, roof repairs and replacements, chimney work, external painting and rendering, window installations, gutter repairs, solar panel fitting, and heritage property restoration."
  - question: "How is residential scaffolding different from commercial scaffolding?"
    answer: "Residential scaffolding is typically smaller scale, designed for single family homes with standard domestic load requirements, and focuses on minimizing disruption to family life and neighbors with homeowner-friendly scheduling."
  - question: "How much does scaffolding cost for a typical house?"
    answer: "Residential scaffolding costs vary by house size and project duration. A typical 3-bedroom semi-detached house might cost £800-£1,500 for basic access, while larger properties can range from £2,000-£5,000."
  - question: "How long can I keep residential scaffolding up?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can remain in place for 8-12 weeks initially, which covers typical home improvement projects. Extensions can be arranged for longer projects with weekly or monthly hire rates available."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding on my house?"
    answer: "Scaffolding itself typically doesn't require planning permission, but you may need a license if it extends onto public highways. For listed buildings or conservation areas, notification is required. We handle all necessary permits."
  - question: "Will scaffolding damage my garden, driveway, or property?"
    answer: "Professional residential scaffolding uses protective measures including base plates, protective boards for driveways, scaffold socks for walls, and careful positioning to minimize garden disruption. Any unavoidable disturbance is discussed beforehand."
  - question: "What insurance do I need for residential scaffolding?"
    answer: "Reputable scaffolding companies carry public liability insurance (minimum £10 million). Homeowners should inform their home insurance provider that scaffolding will be erected, as it can affect security and access."
  - question: "Is residential scaffolding safe for families with children and pets?"
    answer: "Yes, when properly installed by qualified professionals. Safety features include secure fencing at ground level, locked access points, netting where appropriate, and clear safety briefings for families."
  - question: "How much does scaffolding cost per week in Sussex?"
    answer: "Scaffolding hire rates typically range from £200-£500 per week depending on the size and complexity of your project. Factors affecting cost include scaffold height, access requirements, and hire duration. We provide free, detailed quotes tailored to your specific needs."
  - question: "How long does scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can be erected in 4-8 hours, while commercial projects may take 1-3 days. We schedule installations to minimise disruption and can often complete same-day setup for standard domestic projects."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding?"
    answer: "Scaffolding on private property typically doesn't require planning permission. However, if scaffolding extends onto public pavements or highways, you'll need a licence from the local council. We handle all necessary permits and licences on your behalf."
