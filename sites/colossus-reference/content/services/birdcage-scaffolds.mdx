faqs:
  - question: "What is a birdcage scaffold and when is it used?"
    answer: "A birdcage scaffold is an independent scaffold structure with standards (vertical poles) and ledgers creating a 'cage-like' grid pattern. It's used for ceiling work, internal access, large open spaces, and situations requiring a stable platform that doesn't rely on wall support."
  - question: "What are the advantages of birdcage scaffolding over other systems?"
    answer: "Birdcage scaffolds provide complete floor coverage with maximum stability, don't require wall ties, offer flexible access points from all sides, and create safe working platforms ideal for plastering, painting ceilings, MEP installations, and other overhead work."
  - question: "Can birdcage scaffolds support heavy loads?"
    answer: "Yes. Birdcage structures are extremely stable and can be designed for heavy duty applications including material storage, equipment positioning, and multiple workers. Load capacity is calculated during design to meet your specific requirements."
  - question: "How quickly can a birdcage scaffold be erected?"
    answer: "Erection time depends on size and height. A small room might take 1 day, while large commercial spaces may require 3-7 days. Our modular systems allow efficient installation and modification as your project progresses."
  - question: "Can birdcage scaffolds be used in occupied buildings?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Birdcage scaffolds are ideal for refurbishment work in occupied commercial buildings, schools, and churches across Brighton, Canterbury, and surrounding areas. We coordinate installation to minimize disruption to ongoing operations."
  - question: "What ceiling heights can birdcage scaffolding reach?"
    answer: "Birdcage scaffolds can be built to any practical height, from domestic ceiling work at 3-4 meters to commercial spaces exceeding 15 meters. The independent structure allows for safe access at any elevation required."
  - question: "Is birdcage scaffolding suitable for heritage buildings?"
    answer: "Yes. Birdcage structures don't require wall fixings, making them perfect for heritage properties in Canterbury and Hastings where wall penetration isn't permitted. They distribute load safely across floor areas without damaging historic fabric."
  - question: "Do you dismantle and modify birdcage scaffolds as work progresses?"
    answer: "Yes. We can adapt, reduce, or reconfigure birdcage scaffolds throughout your project as different areas are completed, ensuring you only pay for the scaffold you need at each stage."

  - question: "How much does birdcage scaffolding cost?"
    answer: "Birdcage scaffold costs depend on floor coverage area, platform height, and project duration. Small room installations typically cost £500-£1,500, while large commercial spaces can range from £3,000-£15,000+. We provide detailed quotations based on your specific coverage and access requirements."
  - question: "What floor loading does birdcage scaffolding require?"
    answer: "Birdcage scaffolds distribute load across multiple base plates, typically requiring floors capable of supporting 2-3 kN/m2. For weaker floors or historic buildings, we can use larger base plates, sole boards, or spreader beams to reduce point loads. Floor assessment is included in our site survey."
  - question: "Can birdcage scaffolds incorporate stair access or multiple levels?"
    answer: "Yes, birdcage scaffolds can be designed with integrated stair towers for easy access and multiple working levels at different heights. This is particularly useful for large commercial projects where different trades need access at varying heights simultaneously."
