faqs:
  - question: "Why are scaffold alarms important for construction security?"
    answer: "Scaffold alarms prevent unauthorized access, reducing theft, vandalism, and liability from trespassers climbing scaffolding. They deter criminals, protect the public (especially children), and satisfy insurance requirements, often reducing premiums for sites with active security systems."
  - question: "How do scaffold alarm systems work?"
    answer: "Our scaffold alarms use motion sensors or beam interruption technology to detect unauthorized climbing. When triggered, they emit loud audible alarms (typically 100+ decibels), alert security services or site managers via mobile notification, and act as powerful deterrents to potential intruders."
  - question: "Are scaffold alarms required by insurance companies?"
    answer: "Many insurers now require or strongly recommend scaffold alarms, especially for residential properties, high-value sites, or areas with previous theft issues. Alarms can reduce insurance premiums and are often mandatory for policy coverage on vulnerable sites."
  - question: "Can scaffold alarms be used on residential properties?"
    answer: "Yes. Scaffold alarms are ideal for residential projects in Brighton, Hastings, and Canterbury where scaffolding creates access risks. They protect homeowners from liability if trespassers use scaffolding to access properties, and deter opportunistic burglaries via scaffold access."
  - question: "How quickly can scaffold alarms be installed?"
    answer: "Scaffold alarms are typically installed within 2-4 hours on existing scaffolding. We can fit alarms simultaneously with scaffold erection, or retrofit them to scaffolds already in place, with immediate activation upon installation."
  - question: "What happens when a scaffold alarm is triggered?"
    answer: "When triggered, alarms sound loudly to deter intruders and alert neighbors. Depending on your chosen system, they can also send instant mobile alerts to site managers, property owners, or security response teams, enabling rapid response to incidents."
  - question: "Do scaffold alarms work in all weather conditions?"
    answer: "Yes. Our scaffold alarm systems are weatherproof and designed for UK coastal conditions, functioning reliably in rain, wind, and coastal environments typical of Sussex and Kent. Battery-powered systems include regular maintenance checks throughout hire periods."
  - question: "Can alarms be adjusted to prevent false triggers?"
    answer: "Yes. Modern scaffold alarms feature sensitivity adjustments to minimize false alarms from wildlife, weather, or passing pedestrians while maintaining effective security. We configure systems during installation to suit your specific site conditions and requirements."

  - question: "How much do scaffold alarms cost to hire?"
    answer: "Scaffold alarm hire typically costs £50-£150 per week depending on the system type and monitoring options. Basic audible alarms are most economical, while systems with mobile alerts or professional monitoring cost more. Alarm hire can often reduce insurance costs, offsetting the investment."
  - question: "What battery life do scaffold alarms have?"
    answer: "Our scaffold alarm batteries typically last 4-8 weeks between changes, depending on usage and weather conditions. We include battery maintenance as part of our alarm hire service, with regular checks during scaffold inspections to ensure continuous protection throughout your project."
  - question: "Can scaffold alarms be integrated with CCTV or other security?"
    answer: "Yes, scaffold alarms can be combined with temporary CCTV, motion-activated lighting, and remote monitoring services for comprehensive site security. We can recommend integrated security solutions based on your site's specific risks and insurance requirements."
