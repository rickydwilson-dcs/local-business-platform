faqs:
  - question: "Why are scaffold alarms important for construction security?"
    answer: "Scaffold alarms prevent unauthorized access, reducing theft, vandalism, and liability from trespassers climbing scaffolding. They deter criminals, protect the public (especially children), and satisfy insurance requirements, often reducing premiums for sites with active security systems."
  - question: "How do scaffold alarm systems work?"
    answer: "Our scaffold alarms use motion sensors or beam interruption technology to detect unauthorized climbing. When triggered, they emit loud audible alarms (typically 100+ decibels), alert security services or site managers via mobile notification, and act as powerful deterrents to potential intruders."
  - question: "Are scaffold alarms required by insurance companies?"
    answer: "Many insurers now require or strongly recommend scaffold alarms, especially for residential properties, high-value sites, or areas with previous theft issues. Alarms can reduce insurance premiums and are often mandatory for policy coverage on vulnerable sites."
  - question: "Can scaffold alarms be used on residential properties?"
    answer: "Yes. Scaffold alarms are ideal for residential projects in Brighton, Hastings, and Canterbury where scaffolding creates access risks. They protect homeowners from liability if trespassers use scaffolding to access properties, and deter opportunistic burglaries via scaffold access."
  - question: "How quickly can scaffold alarms be installed?"
    answer: "Scaffold alarms are typically installed within 2-4 hours on existing scaffolding. We can fit alarms simultaneously with scaffold erection, or retrofit them to scaffolds already in place, with immediate activation upon installation."
  - question: "What happens when a scaffold alarm is triggered?"
    answer: "When triggered, alarms sound loudly to deter intruders and alert neighbors. Depending on your chosen system, they can also send instant mobile alerts to site managers, property owners, or security response teams, enabling rapid response to incidents."
  - question: "Do scaffold alarms work in all weather conditions?"
    answer: "Yes. Our scaffold alarm systems are weatherproof and designed for UK coastal conditions, functioning reliably in rain, wind, and coastal environments typical of Sussex and Kent. Battery-powered systems include regular maintenance checks throughout hire periods."
  - question: "Can alarms be adjusted to prevent false triggers?"
    answer: "Yes. Modern scaffold alarms feature sensitivity adjustments to minimize false alarms from wildlife, weather, or passing pedestrians while maintaining effective security. We configure systems during installation to suit your specific site conditions and requirements."

  - question: "How much does scaffolding cost per week in Sussex?"
    answer: "Scaffolding hire rates typically range from £200-£500 per week depending on the size and complexity of your project. Factors affecting cost include scaffold height, access requirements, and hire duration. We provide free, detailed quotes tailored to your specific needs."
  - question: "How long does scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can be erected in 4-8 hours, while commercial projects may take 1-3 days. We schedule installations to minimise disruption and can often complete same-day setup for standard domestic projects."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding?"
    answer: "Scaffolding on private property typically doesn't require planning permission. However, if scaffolding extends onto public pavements or highways, you'll need a licence from the local council. We handle all necessary permits and licences on your behalf."
