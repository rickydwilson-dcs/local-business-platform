faqs:
  - question: "What's the difference between scaffold towers and mast climbing systems?"
    answer: "Scaffold towers are modular, self-supporting structures ideal for heights up to 12 meters with quick installation. Mast climbers are motorized platforms that ride up vertical masts, perfect for tall buildings and repetitive elevation work, offering faster repositioning than traditional scaffolding."
  - question: "When should I choose a mast climber over traditional scaffolding?"
    answer: "Mast climbers excel on tall buildings, facades requiring multiple elevation changes, projects with tight site access, or when you need to move the work platform frequently. They're faster to adjust, more economical for heights above 20 meters, and require less ground space."
  - question: "How quickly can scaffold towers be installed?"
    answer: "Mobile scaffold towers can typically be erected within 2-4 hours for standard heights. Larger tower systems may take 1-2 days. Their modular design allows rapid installation and dismantling, making them ideal for short-term access requirements."
  - question: "Are mast climbing systems safe in coastal wind conditions?"
    answer: "Yes. Our mast climbers are engineered with wind loading calculations and can be used safely in coastal areas like Brighton and Hastings. We monitor weather conditions and implement safety protocols including securing the platform during high winds."
  - question: "What heights can your scaffold towers and mast systems reach?"
    answer: "Mobile towers typically reach 8-12 meters efficiently. Our mast climbing systems can access heights of 100+ meters, making them suitable for high-rise buildings, large commercial developments, and industrial structures throughout Kent and Sussex."
  - question: "How much do mast climbers cost compared to traditional scaffolding?"
    answer: "For projects over 20 meters high, mast climbers are often more cost-effective due to faster installation, easier repositioning, and reduced hire duration. We provide detailed cost comparisons during your free site survey."
  - question: "Can multiple workers use mast climbing work platforms?"
    answer: "Yes. Our mast climbing platforms are designed for multiple workers and can accommodate tools, materials, and equipment. Load capacity varies by model and is specified to meet your project requirements and safety regulations."

  - question: "What certifications are required to operate mast climbing systems?"
    answer: "Mast climber operators require IPAF (International Powered Access Federation) certification specific to the type of equipment being used. We provide fully trained and certified operators for all our mast climbing equipment, ensuring safe and compliant operation throughout your project."
  - question: "How much do scaffold towers cost to hire?"
    answer: "Mobile scaffold tower hire typically costs £75-£200 per week for standard heights up to 6m, and £150-£350 per week for taller systems. Mast climbing systems are priced based on platform size, height requirements, and project duration. We provide detailed quotations following site assessment."
  - question: "What ground conditions are needed for scaffold towers and mast climbers?"
    answer: "Scaffold towers require firm, level ground with adequate load-bearing capacity. Mast climbers need solid foundations capable of supporting the mast anchor loads. We assess ground conditions during site surveys and specify any groundworks or foundation requirements."
