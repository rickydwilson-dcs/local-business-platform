faqs:
  - question: "How does Brighton's coastal location affect residential scaffolding?"
    answer: "Brighton's seaside environment requires specialist coastal-rated scaffolding with enhanced wind loading for seafront properties, marine-grade corrosion-resistant materials for salt-air protection, weather monitoring systems for coastal storms, and adaptive tie-down configurations specifically for the challenging maritime conditions."
  - question: "Can you work on Victorian terraces in The Lanes and narrow Brighton streets?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We specialize in Brighton's characteristic narrow Victorian terraces with compact equipment for limited frontage access, heritage-sensitive installation for conservation areas, and coordination with neighbors in densely-packed residential streets."

  - question: "How do you handle access and parking in Brighton's narrow residential streets?"
    answer: "We coordinate with Brighton & Hove City Council for temporary parking suspensions, highway licenses for narrow streets, and resident parking zone arrangements. Our specialized compact equipment is designed for The Lanes' medieval street patterns and Victorian terrace access."
  - question: "Will scaffolding damage my Brighton garden or driveway?"
    answer: "We use comprehensive protective measures including base plates, protective boards for driveways, scaffold socks for walls, and careful positioning. Our teams understand Brighton's often limited garden spaces and take extra care with coastal gardens."
