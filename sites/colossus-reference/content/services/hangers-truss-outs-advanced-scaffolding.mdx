about:
  whatIs: "Hangers, truss-outs and advanced scaffolding systems provide engineered solutions for complex structural access where standard scaffolding cannot reach. Hangers are brackets fixed to existing structures to support scaffold platforms, while truss-outs are cantilever beams extending scaffolding beyond the building line. These TG20:21 compliant systems are designed by qualified engineers and support loads of 1.5-3.0 kN/m2, providing safe access for facade work, roof overhangs, and areas where ground-based scaffolding is impractical."
  whenNeeded:
    - "Roof overhang access requiring cantilever scaffolding"
    - "Building facade work beyond the building footprint"
    - "Soffit and fascia repairs where ground scaffolding cannot reach"
    - "Chimney stack and parapet wall access"
    - "Bridge inspection and maintenance requiring underside access"
    - "High-rise building exterior where standard scaffolding is impractical"
    - "Complex structural access requiring engineered solutions"
    - "Conservation and heritage projects with restricted ground access"
  whatAchieve:
    - "Safe access beyond the building footprint using cantilever systems"
    - "Load capacity from 250kg to 1,500kg per platform"
    - "Reach up to 2.4m beyond the building line with truss-outs"
    - "Integration with fall arrest systems meeting BS 8437"
    - "Reduced project costs compared to alternative access methods"
    - "Minimal disruption to pedestrians and traffic below"
    - "Compliant access for difficult-to-reach structures"
  keyPoints:
    - "TG20:21 compliant hanger and truss-out designs"
    - "Structural engineer calculations for all cantilever loads"
    - "CISRS Advanced scaffolder qualifications required"
    - "Load testing and certification for all fixing points"
    - "Full documentation and method statements provided"
faqs:
  - question: "What are scaffold hangers and truss-outs?"
    answer: "Scaffold hangers are engineered brackets fixed to existing structures (such as roof beams or structural steel) to support scaffold platforms where ground-based scaffolding cannot reach. Truss-outs are cantilever beams that extend scaffolding beyond the building line, providing access to overhangs, soffits, and areas outside the building footprint."
  - question: "Are hanger and truss-out systems safe?"
    answer: "Yes, when properly designed and installed. All hanger and truss-out systems require structural engineer calculations, load testing of fixing points, and installation by CISRS Advanced qualified scaffolders. Every system is designed to TG20:21 standards with full documentation and method statements."
  - question: "What types of projects require advanced scaffolding systems?"
    answer: "Roof overhang repairs, soffit and fascia work, chimney stack access, parapet wall maintenance, building facade work beyond the footprint, heritage conservation projects with restricted ground access, and any situation where standard scaffolding cannot reach the work area."
  - question: "How far can truss-outs extend beyond a building?"
    answer: "Truss-outs can typically extend up to 2.4m beyond the building line, depending on load requirements and structural fixing points. For longer reaches, multiple truss-outs or alternative cantilever configurations may be designed by our structural engineers."
  - question: "What engineering is required for hanger and truss-out systems?"
    answer: "All advanced scaffolding systems require comprehensive structural design including fixing point calculations, cantilever load analysis, and platform specifications. Designs must be certified by qualified engineers and include full documentation for site inspection and handover."
  - question: "Can hangers be used on listed buildings or conservation areas?"
    answer: "Yes. We regularly install hanger and truss-out systems on heritage properties throughout Sussex and Kent. Our engineers design non-invasive fixing methods that protect historic fabric while providing safe access. All work is documented for planning and conservation requirements."
  - question: "How long does it take to install hanger and truss-out systems?"
    answer: "Installation varies based on complexity and access requirements. Simple hanger installations may take 1-2 days, while complex multi-point truss-out configurations can require 3-5 days including load testing and certification."
  - question: "What safety systems are included with advanced scaffolding?"
    answer: "Comprehensive safety systems include engineered fixing brackets, load-tested connections, guardrails and toe boards, fall arrest anchorage points, and regular competent person inspections throughout the hire period."
  - question: "What load capacities do hanger and truss-out platforms support?"
    answer: "Our hanger and truss-out platforms are engineered for working loads from 250kg to 1,500kg depending on configuration and fixing point capacity. All platforms are designed to TG20:21 standards with appropriate safety factors for the specified use."
  - question: "What documentation is provided with advanced scaffolding systems?"
    answer: "All installations include comprehensive documentation: structural engineer calculations, fixing point specifications, load capacity certificates, handover certificates, inspection schedules, and method statements covering installation and use."
  - question: "What qualifications are required for hanger and truss-out installation?"
    answer: "Hanger and truss-out systems require installation by CISRS Advanced qualified scaffolders with specific training in cantilever and suspension systems. All fixing points must be certified by a structural engineer, and our teams hold full competency cards for complex scaffold configurations."
