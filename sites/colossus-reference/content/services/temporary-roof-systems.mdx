faqs:
  - question: "What are temporary roof systems and when are they needed?"
    answer: "Temporary roof systems provide weather protection for buildings during roof replacement, major repairs, or structural work. They're essential when your building needs to remain dry and operational while the permanent roof is removed or being repaired."

    answer: "Yes. Our temporary roof systems are fully weatherproof and designed to protect against rain, snow, and wind. They allow interior work to continue uninterrupted regardless of weather conditions, preventing water damage and project delays."
  - question: "How quickly can you install a temporary roof system?"
