  - question: "Do you offer scaffolding for multi-tenant commercial buildings?"
    answer: "Yes, we regularly work on multi-tenant buildings where access must be coordinated across multiple businesses. We create phased installation plans, provide advance notice to all affected parties, and can configure scaffolding to maintain separate access routes for different tenants."
