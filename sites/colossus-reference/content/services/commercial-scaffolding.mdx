faqs:
  - question: "What types of projects qualify as commercial scaffolding?"
    answer: "Commercial scaffolding covers all business-related properties including office buildings, retail shops, shopping centres, hotels, restaurants, warehouses, educational facilities, healthcare buildings, and public sector properties."
  - question: "How does commercial scaffolding differ from residential scaffolding?"
    answer: "Commercial scaffolding typically involves larger-scale structures, more complex design requirements, stricter health and safety regulations, and the need to minimize business disruption."
  - question: "What certifications are required for commercial scaffolding work?"
    answer: "Professional commercial scaffolding requires CISRS qualified scaffolders, TG20:21 design compliance, adequate public liability insurance (typically £10 million for commercial work), and CHAS accreditation."
  - question: "How much does commercial scaffolding typically cost?"
    answer: "Commercial scaffolding costs vary significantly based on building height, project duration, site access, and complexity. Small commercial projects might start from £1,500-£3,000, while large multi-story buildings can range from £10,000-£50,000+."
  - question: "How long does commercial scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Installation timelines depend on building size and complexity. A small commercial property might take 1-2 days to erect, while larger multi-story buildings can require 5-10 days or more."
  - question: "What insurance is required for commercial scaffolding projects?"
    answer: "Commercial scaffolding requires comprehensive public liability insurance (minimum £10 million), employer's liability insurance, and professional indemnity insurance."
  - question: "Can you work around our business operating hours?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We understand that business continuity is crucial for commercial clients. We offer flexible scheduling including out-of-hours installation (evenings, weekends, bank holidays)."
  - question: "What are the common challenges with commercial scaffolding projects?"
    answer: "Commercial projects often face challenges including limited site access in busy areas, high pedestrian traffic requiring protection systems, coordinating with multiple stakeholders, and working around business operations."

  - question: "How much does scaffolding cost per week in Sussex?"
    answer: "Scaffolding hire rates typically range from £200-£500 per week depending on the size and complexity of your project. Factors affecting cost include scaffold height, access requirements, and hire duration. We provide free, detailed quotes tailored to your specific needs."
  - question: "How long does scaffolding installation take?"
    answer: "Most residential scaffolding can be erected in 4-8 hours, while commercial projects may take 1-3 days. We schedule installations to minimise disruption and can often complete same-day setup for standard domestic projects."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for scaffolding?"
    answer: "Scaffolding on private property typically doesn't require planning permission. However, if scaffolding extends onto public pavements or highways, you'll need a licence from the local council. We handle all necessary permits and licences on your behalf."

## How Our Commercial Scaffolding Process Works

We understand that commercial projects require careful coordination to minimize business disruption:

1. **Initial Consultation** - Contact us to discuss your commercial project requirements. We'll gather information about the building, access needs, and operational constraints.

2. **Site Survey & Assessment** - Our commercial team conducts a comprehensive site survey, assessing building dimensions, access points, public areas, pedestrian flow, and any operational considerations.

3. **Design & Engineering** - We create a TG20:21 compliant scaffold design, considering load requirements, multiple access points, and any specialist configurations your project requires.

4. **Detailed Quotation** - You receive a transparent commercial quote covering all aspects including permits, inspections, and any out-of-hours work requirements.

5. **Permit Management** - We handle all highway authority permits, pavement licenses, and local council applications on your behalf.

6. **Coordinated Installation** - Our team works to your schedule, offering out-of-hours installation to minimize business impact. Installation is completed efficiently with full safety protocols.

7. **Ongoing Support** - Throughout your project, we provide 7-day statutory inspections, modifications as needed, and responsive support for any requirements.

8. **Professional Dismantling** - Upon project completion, we coordinate removal with your operations team and restore the site to its original condition.
