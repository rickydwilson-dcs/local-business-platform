Choosing scaffolding isn't about selecting a standard package. It's about matching the access solution to the work, the site, and the risks.

<InfoBox type="info" title="At a glance">

- Start with the work, not the scaffold
- Match the scaffold to the access need
- Factor in site constraints early
- Expect clear safety and inspection standards
- Better information = better pricing

</InfoBox>

## Start with the work

Before you think about scaffolding types, define what you're trying to achieve:

- **Type of work:** Brickwork, roofing, painting, window installation?
- **Height required:** Ground floor, full elevation, chimney access?
- **Duration:** Days, weeks, or months?
- **Materials stored:** Just tools, or heavy loads like tiles or bricks?
- **Number of users:** One person at a time, or a full crew?

The work scope drives everything else.

## Common scaffold types

Here's what you're likely to encounter — and when each one makes sense.

| Type | Best for | Advantages | Considerations |
|------|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Independent (tied)** | Renovations, roofing | Versatile, stable | Requires secure ties |
| **Facade** | Full elevations | Continuous access | Boundary / pavement issues |
| **Tube & fitting / Ringlock** | Complex structures | Highly adaptable | Design complexity |
| **Single (bricklayer's)** | Brickwork | Cost-effective | Limited scope |
| **Double** | Heavy masonry | Extra stability | More materials |
| **Birdcage** | Interior ceilings | Full platform | Floor space required |
| **Cantilever** | Conservatories | Avoids weak ground | Specialist design |
| **Suspended** | Maintenance | No ground obstruction | Limited use |
| **Tower** | Short tasks | Mobile, quick | Not for heavy work |

## Match scaffold to project

### Residential

- Loft conversions, extensions, re-roofing
- Independent tied scaffold is typical
- Consider neighbour boundaries and garden access

### Commercial

- Full elevation access for maintenance or refurb
- Often requires pavement licenses
- Debris netting and pedestrian protection

### Interior refurbishment

- Birdcage or tower scaffold
- Load floor capacity carefully
- Protect finishes during erection

## Site constraints

Real-world sites rarely offer perfect conditions. Watch for:

- **Ground conditions:** Soft soil, slopes, cellars, drains
- **Obstructions:** Trees, extensions, conservatories
- **Access routes:** Narrow side passages, locked gates
- **Public interfaces:** Pavements, roads, shared access
- **Neighbours:** Party walls, overhangs, boundary disputes

Identify these **early**. They affect design, cost, and schedule.

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Safety and compliance essentials">

Every scaffold must include:

- Safe access (staircase or ladder)
- Guardrails and toe boards
- Proper foundations (base plates or sole boards)
- Ties and anchoring to structure
- Handover certificate
- 7-day inspections (and after weather events)

These aren't negotiable. If they're missing, don't use it.

## What affects cost

Scaffolding pricing varies based on:

- **Height and length:** More materials = higher cost
- **Bridging or cantilever sections:** Specialist design
- **Public protection:** Fans, loading bays, netting
- **Access difficulty:** Narrow routes, manual handling
- **Duration:** Longer hire = lower weekly rate
- **Temporary roofing or sheeting:** Weather protection adds cost

## FAQs

**Do I need scaffolding for roof work?**
Depends on pitch, height, and duration. Low-pitch extensions may suit a tower; steep roofs or full re-slates need proper independent scaffold.

**Is a tower scaffold cheaper?**
For short tasks (painting a gable end, fixing a gutter), yes. For sustained work at height, independent scaffold is safer and more practical.

**Can scaffolding go over a pavement?**
Yes, but you'll need a pavement license from the local authority. Your scaffolding contractor should handle this.

**How long does erection take?**
A typical two-storey house takes 1–2 days. Larger or more complex jobs can take a week. Dismantling is usually quicker.
