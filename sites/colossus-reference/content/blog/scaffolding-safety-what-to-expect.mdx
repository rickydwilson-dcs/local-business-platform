Scaffolding is there to make work safer, not riskier.
Knowing what to expect on site helps you spot good practice and avoid unnecessary hazards.

This guide explains the key safety measures you should see on any professional scaffold installation.

---

## Before the scaffold is used

A properly installed scaffold should include:
- A stable base with suitable base plates or sole boards
- Secure ties or anchoring to the structure where required
- Guardrails and toe boards at exposed edges
- Safe ladder or stair access
- Clear working platforms free from gaps or trip hazards

You should not be asked to use a scaffold before it's formally handed over.

## Handover and inspections

Once erected, a scaffold should be:
- **Handed over** as safe to use
- **Inspected** before first use
- **Re-inspected regularly**, especially:
  - After alterations
  - After severe weather
  - At defined inspection intervals

Inspections are a critical part of ongoing safety, not a box-ticking exercise.

---

## During the project

While work is ongoing, expect:
- Clear access routes kept free of materials
- Edge protection maintained at all times
- Loads kept within safe limits
- No unauthorised modifications

If something looks wrong, work should stop until it's checked.

---

## Public and neighbour safety

Where scaffolding affects others, additional measures may include:
- Debris netting or fans
- Pedestrian barriers or tunnels
- Warning signage
- Safety lighting for night-time visibility

These controls protect both the public and the project.

---

## Common safety red flags

Be cautious if you see:
- Missing guardrails or toe boards
- Unsecured ladders
- Loose or damaged boards
- Ad-hoc changes by non-scaffolders
- Pressure to "just use it" before checks are complete

Safety shortcuts usually lead to delays later.

---

## Why this matters

Good scaffolding safety:
- Protects workers and occupants
- Reduces the risk of accidents
- Keeps projects compliant and on schedule

It's not an optional extra — it's fundamental.
