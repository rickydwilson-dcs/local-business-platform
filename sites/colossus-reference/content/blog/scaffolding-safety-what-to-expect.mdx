# Scaffolding Safety: What to Expect on Site

*What safe scaffolding looks like — and what you should never accept.*

Scaffolding exists to reduce risk, not create it. Knowing what safe practice looks like helps you recognise quality work and avoid unnecessary hazards on site.

This guide outlines the key safety measures you should expect before, during, and throughout a scaffolding project.

---

## Before the scaffold is used

Before anyone works from a scaffold, it should be fully installed and checked. You should never be asked to use a scaffold that hasn’t been formally handed over.

A safe scaffold will include:
- Stable foundations and base plates
- Secure ties or anchoring where required
- Guardrails and toe boards at exposed edges
- Safe ladder or stair access
- Platforms that are fully boarded and free from hazards

---

## Handover and inspections

Once erected, scaffolding should be inspected before first use and at regular intervals thereafter. Inspections are especially important after alterations, severe weather, or periods of inactivity.

This process ensures the scaffold remains safe as conditions change.

---

## During the project

While work is ongoing, good site discipline matters. Platforms should be kept clear, loads controlled, and unauthorised modifications avoided.

If something looks unsafe, work should stop until it is checked and corrected.

---

## Public and neighbour safety

Where scaffolding affects others, additional controls may be required, such as debris netting, pedestrian barriers, signage, or safety lighting. These measures protect both the public and the project.

---

## Common safety red flags

Be cautious if you see missing edge protection, unsecured ladders, damaged boards, or pressure to “just use it” without checks. These shortcuts often lead to incidents.

---

## Why safety matters

Good scaffolding safety protects people, prevents delays, and keeps projects compliant. It’s not optional — it’s fundamental.
