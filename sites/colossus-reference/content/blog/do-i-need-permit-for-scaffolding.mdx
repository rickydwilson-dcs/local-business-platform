# Do I Need a Permit for Scaffolding?

*When scaffolding needs permission — and when it doesn’t.*

Whether scaffolding requires a permit is one of the most common questions we’re asked. The answer depends entirely on **where the scaffold will be positioned**, not on the type of work being carried out.

Understanding this early helps avoid delays, enforcement action, and unnecessary changes once a project is underway.

## When a permit is required

A permit is usually required if any part of the scaffold:
- Sits on a public pavement or footpath
- Extends over a road or public highway
- Affects public access, visibility, or traffic
- Requires pedestrian barriers, tunnels, or safety lighting

In these situations, local authorities need to ensure that public safety is protected.

## When a permit is not required

A permit is generally not needed when scaffolding:
- Is fully within private land
- Does not overhang or obstruct public space
- Does not interfere with public access

Typical examples include scaffolding within private gardens or rear elevations with no public interface.

## Who applies for the permit?

In most cases, the scaffolding contractor applies for the permit on your behalf. This usually includes submitting drawings, providing insurance details, and arranging any required safety measures.

Clients should still flag early if pavements or roads may be affected, as permits can influence start dates.

## How long do permits take?

Timescales vary by council, but standard pavement permits typically take between **five and ten working days**. More complex arrangements, such as road closures, can take longer.

---

## What happens if scaffolding is installed without a permit?

Installing scaffolding on public land without permission can result in enforcement action, fines, or forced removal — all of which cause delays and additional cost.

Reputable scaffolding companies will not proceed without the correct approvals in place.

## How to avoid delays

To keep projects moving:
- Raise access questions early
- Provide clear site photos
- Build permit time into your programme
