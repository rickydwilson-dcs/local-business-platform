Winter presents additional challenges for scaffolding projects across the South East. From icy platforms to reduced daylight hours, cold weather increases risk if it isn’t properly managed.

With the right preparation, scaffolding work can continue safely throughout the winter months. This guide outlines the key hazards to be aware of — and the practical steps that reduce risk on site.

## Understanding winter scaffolding hazards

The most common risks during winter scaffolding work include:

- **Ice and frost** on platforms, ladders, and handrails
- **Reduced visibility** due to shorter daylight hours, fog, or poor weather
- **Strong winds** affecting stability and material handling
- **Cold stress** reducing dexterity, concentration, and reaction times
- **Wet conditions** increasing slip risk

These hazards can change daily — or even hourly — making regular checks essential.

## Pre-work inspections in cold weather

Before work starts on winter mornings, scaffolds should be checked thoroughly.

Key inspection points include:
1. Platforms free from ice, frost, or standing water  
2. Guardrails and toe boards secure and undamaged  
3. Ladders and access points clean, dry, and stable  
4. Handrails providing adequate grip  
5. Ground conditions around the scaffold base sound and uncompromised  

If conditions are unsafe, work should not begin until they are addressed.

## Ice prevention and treatment

Never assume platforms are safe simply because they look dry. Early morning frost can be difficult to see and extremely dangerous once weight is applied.

Effective control measures include:
- Applying grit or sand to platforms before use
- Using approved anti-ice treatments in high-traffic areas
- Keeping drainage holes clear to prevent water pooling
- Covering platforms overnight where practical
- Installing non-slip mats at access points

Preventative measures taken early often avoid delays later.

## Wind safety protocols

Winter weather systems can bring sudden high winds, particularly on exposed sites.

Best practice includes:
- Monitoring weather forecasts daily
- Establishing clear wind speed limits (typically around 23 mph for general work, subject to design)
- Securing loose materials and sheeting
- Using debris netting where appropriate to reduce wind loading
- Having a clear stop-work and evacuation procedure if conditions deteriorate

Wind is one of the most underestimated winter risks — especially at height.

## Adapting working hours in winter

Shorter days mean less natural light and narrower working windows.

To manage this safely:
- Schedule high-risk tasks during peak daylight hours
- Install and test adequate task lighting
- Use high-visibility PPE at all times
- Allow extra time for cold-weather preparation
- Plan lower-risk or internal tasks for darker periods where possible

Good planning reduces pressure to rush.

## TG20:21 and winter compliance

TG20:21 guidance places specific emphasis on weather-related risks.

During winter:
- Scaffolds must be inspected after adverse weather
- Wind exposure should be assessed for exposed or high structures
- Weather-related inspections should be documented
- Additional controls may be required for high-risk locations

Compliance isn’t paperwork — it’s a safety control.

---

## Worker welfare in cold conditions

Cold weather affects both physical ability and concentration.

Support on site should include:
- Heated welfare facilities where possible
- Regular warm-up breaks (more frequent in sub-zero temperatures)
- Suitable cold-weather PPE, including thermal gloves
- Access to hot drinks
- Awareness of cold stress and early symptoms

Looking after people reduces incidents and downtime.

---

## Emergency procedures in winter

Emergency planning should be reviewed for winter conditions.

Consider:
- Rescue plans adapted for icy platforms
- First aid provisions for cold exposure or hypothermia
- Clear access routes kept free of snow or ice
- Gritting materials readily available
- Updated emergency contact procedures for shorter working days

Preparation matters most when things don’t go to plan.

## Conclusion

Winter scaffolding work demands additional vigilance, planning, and discipline. Ice, wind, and reduced daylight increase risk — but they don’t need to stop work entirely.

With proper inspections, sensible controls, and a safety-first mindset, projects can continue safely throughout the colder months.
