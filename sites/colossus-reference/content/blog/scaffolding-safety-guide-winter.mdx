Winter presents unique challenges for scaffolding projects across the South East. From icy platforms to reduced daylight hours, understanding and managing these risks is essential for maintaining safe working conditions. This guide covers the key safety considerations for scaffolding work during the colder months.

## Understanding Winter Hazards

The primary hazards during winter scaffolding work include:

- **Ice and frost** on platforms, ladders, and handrails
- **Reduced visibility** due to shorter daylight hours and fog
- **Strong winds** that can affect scaffold stability
- **Cold stress** affecting worker performance and safety
- **Wet conditions** making surfaces slippery

## Pre-Work Inspections

Before any work begins on winter mornings, conduct thorough inspections:

1. Check all platforms for ice or frost accumulation
2. Inspect toe boards and guardrails for damage from overnight weather
3. Verify ladder rungs are clear and dry
4. Test handrail grip surfaces
5. Check ground conditions around scaffold base

## Ice Prevention and Treatment

Never assume platforms are safe just because they look dry. Early morning frost can be invisible until weight is applied. Our recommended approach:

- Apply grit or sand to platforms before work begins
- Use proprietary anti-ice treatments on high-traffic areas
- Ensure drainage holes in platforms are clear
- Consider temporary platform covers for overnight protection
- Install non-slip mats at access points

## Wind Safety Protocols

Winter storms can arrive quickly. Our wind safety protocols include:

- Monitor weather forecasts before and during work
- Establish clear wind speed limits (typically 23 mph for general work)
- Secure all loose materials and debris
- Install debris netting to reduce wind loading
- Have a clear evacuation procedure when conditions deteriorate

## Working Hours Adaptation

With fewer daylight hours, planning becomes critical:

- Schedule critical tasks during peak daylight (10am - 2pm)
- Ensure adequate task lighting is installed and tested
- Use high-visibility PPE throughout the working day
- Allow additional time for cold weather setup procedures
- Plan indoor tasks for the darkest hours

## TG20:21 Winter Compliance

The TG20:21 guidance specifically addresses weather considerations:

- Scaffolds must be inspected after adverse weather events
- Wind speed monitoring is mandatory for exposed structures
- Documentation of weather-related inspections is required
- Modification procedures may apply for high-wind locations

## Worker Welfare

Cold weather affects concentration and dexterity. Support your team with:

- Heated welfare facilities close to work areas
- Regular warm-up breaks (every 45 minutes in sub-zero temperatures)
- Appropriate cold weather PPE including thermal gloves
- Hot drinks facilities on site
- Awareness training on cold stress symptoms

## Emergency Procedures

Update your emergency procedures for winter conditions:

- Review rescue plans for icy conditions
- Ensure first aid kits include hypothermia treatment
- Maintain clear access routes even in snow
- Have gritting materials readily available
- Update emergency contact procedures for winter working hours

## Conclusion

Winter scaffolding work requires additional planning, vigilance, and resources, but with proper preparation, projects can continue safely throughout the colder months. The key is never to underestimate winter hazards and always to prioritise safety over schedule pressure.
