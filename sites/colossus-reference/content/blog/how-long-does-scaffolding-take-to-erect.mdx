# How Long Does Scaffolding Take to Erect?

*What affects installation time — and how to plan realistically.*

Scaffolding is often the first trade on site and the last to leave. Understanding how long it takes to erect helps set realistic expectations and keeps projects on schedule.

There’s no single answer, but there are clear factors that influence timescales.

---

## Typical erection times

As a broad guide:
- Simple access scaffolding may be installed within a day
- Full house or facade scaffolding often takes one to two days
- Complex designs or temporary roofs take longer

Actual times depend on site conditions and scope.

---

## What affects installation time?

Installation time is influenced by:
- Height and total length
- Number of working platforms
- Bridging or cantilever sections
- Ground conditions and access
- Permit requirements
- Weather conditions

More complexity means more time — and usually for good reason.

---

## Access matters more than most people expect

Restricted access can significantly slow installation. Long carry distances, narrow paths, or limited storage space all affect efficiency.

Clear access keeps work moving.

---

## Can scaffolding be erected in stages?

Yes. Larger projects are often phased, with scaffolding adapted as work progresses. This can be more efficient than installing everything at once.

---

## How to avoid delays

You can help by providing accurate information, sharing photos, and allowing flexibility for weather or access issues.

---

## Planning your project

Building realistic installation time into your programme helps everything else fall into place.
