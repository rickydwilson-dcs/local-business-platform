text: "Colossus Scaffolding provided excellent service for our Victorian terrace renovation in Brighton. The team was professional from start to finish, the scaffolding was erected safely and efficiently, and they worked around our schedule. The TG20:21 compliance documentation gave us complete peace of mind throughout the 8-week project. Would highly recommend to anyone needing scaffolding for their home."
