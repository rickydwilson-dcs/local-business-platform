>
> Let's start - what type of service business do you run?

**Customer:**

> Hi, I'm a plumber and heating engineer

**Claude:**

> Great! Plumbing and heating is one of our most popular industries. I'll be able to suggest relevant services and certifications as we go.
>
> What's your business name - the name your customers know you by?

---

### Business Basics

**Customer:**

> Sussex Plumbing & Heating

**Claude:**

> Sussex Plumbing & Heating - that's a strong, clear name. Is that also your legal/registered business name, or do you trade under a different company name?

**Customer:**

> That's the trading name. The company is registered as SPH Services Ltd

**Claude:**

> Got it - trading as Sussex Plumbing & Heating, registered as SPH Services Ltd.
>
> Now I need your contact details. What's the best phone number for customers to reach you?

**Customer:**

> 01onal 01273 555 0123

**Claude:**

> Perfect, 01273 555 0123. And your email address for enquiries?

**Customer:**

> info@sussexplumbing.co.uk

**Claude:**

> Great. Do you have an existing website we can reference for style or content?

**Customer:**

**Claude:**

> No problem at all - we'll create something great from scratch!
>
> **So far I have:**

---

### Business Address

**Claude:**

> What's your business address? This helps customers know where you're based.

**Customer:**

> We work from home actually, is that okay?

**Claude:**

> Absolutely, that's very common for trade businesses. We can display your service area instead of a full address. For our records and local SEO purposes, what's your postcode area?

**Customer:**

> BN1 - we're in central Brighton

**Claude:**

> Perfect. I'll note Brighton, East Sussex as your base location. Your website will show "Serving Brighton and surrounding areas" rather than a specific address. Sound good?

**Customer:**

> Yes that's perfect

---

### Opening Hours

**Claude:**

> Now let's set up your availability. What are your typical working hours?

**Customer:**

> Monday to Friday 8am til 6pm usually, Saturdays 9 to 2

**Claude:**

> Great - Monday-Friday 8:00-18:00, Saturday 9:00-14:00, closed Sunday.
>
> As a plumber, do you offer any emergency or out-of-hours service?

**Customer:**

> Yes we do 24/7 emergency callouts for burst pipes and things like that

**Claude:**

> Excellent - that's a really valuable service to highlight. I'll mark you as offering 24/7 emergency availability. Is there a different number for emergencies, or the same one?

**Customer:**

> Same number, it diverts to my mobile out of hours

**Claude:**

> Perfect. I'll note that you offer 24/7 emergency plumbing services.

---

### Credentials & Trust Signals

**Claude:**

> Trust signals are really important for plumbing businesses - customers want to know they're hiring someone qualified and insured.
>
> When was Sussex Plumbing & Heating established?

**Customer:**

> 2015, so coming up to 10 years

**Claude:**

> Nearly 10 years - that's great experience to highlight!
>
> For plumbing and heating work, the key certifications are usually Gas Safe for gas work, and potentially OFTEC for oil. What certifications do you hold?

**Customer:**

> I'm Gas Safe registered, number 123456. Also got City & Guilds in plumbing and I'm on Checkatrade

**Claude:**

> Excellent credentials! Gas Safe #123456, City & Guilds qualified, and Checkatrade verified.
>
> What about insurance - do you have public liability coverage?

**Customer:**

> Yes, 2 million public liability with Hiscox

**Claude:**

> Perfect. Any other insurance or team qualifications I should note?

> Understood - I'll remove Haywards Heath and Burgess Hill.
>
> **Service Areas (East Sussex & West Sussex coast):**
> Brighton, Hove, Worthing, Lewes, Eastbourne, Shoreham-by-Sea, Peacehaven, Newhaven, Rottingdean, Portslade
>
> That's 10 location pages we can create for your website, which is great for local SEO.

---

### Pricing Information

**Claude:**

> Pricing is optional, but many customers appreciate seeing rough costs. Would you like to include any pricing information, or prefer to just offer free quotes?

**Customer:**

> I usually just quote per job. But I can say my callout is 60 quid and gas safety certs are 65

>
> - Callout Fee: GBP 60
> - Gas Safety Certificate: GBP 65
> - General message: "Free quotes available for all other work"
>
> Sound right?

**Customer:**

> Yes that works

---

### Brand Preferences

**Claude:**

> Almost done! Let's talk about how you want your website to look.
>
> Do you have any existing brand colors - maybe from business cards or your van livery?

**Customer:**

> My van is blue and white. Kind of a navy blue

**Claude:**

> Navy blue is perfect for plumbing - it conveys trust, professionalism, and of course relates to water.
>
> Would you say something like this shade? #1E3A5F (dark navy) with white and maybe a lighter blue accent?

**Customer:**

> Yeah that sounds about right

**Claude:**

> Great. What style do you prefer - modern and clean, or more traditional and established?

**Customer:**

> Modern but not too flashy. Professional looking

**Claude:**

> Modern professional - clean lines, easy to read, trustworthy feel. Got it.
>
> Do you have a logo I should know about? We can incorporate it or note that one needs to be created.

**Customer:**

> I've got a simple logo my mate made, just the company name with a tap icon

**Claude:**

> Perfect - we can work with that. You'll be able to upload it when we build the site.

---

### Social Media

**Claude:**

> Finally, which social media platforms do you use for business?

**Customer:**

> Just Facebook really. And I'm on Checkatrade

**Claude:**

> What's your Facebook page URL?

**Customer:**

> facebook.com/sussexplumbingandhheating

**Claude:**

> Got it. And your Checkatrade profile?

**Customer:**

> Not sure of the exact link, it's just under Sussex Plumbing Brighton

**Claude:**

> No problem - we can look that up. Do you have a Google Business Profile? That's really important for showing up in local searches.
